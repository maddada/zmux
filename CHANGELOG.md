# Changelog

## 1.0.4 - 2026-04-28

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-04-28-06:27: Release notes for 1.0.4 must be
derived from the commits after v1.0.3 so README, GitHub, and Homebrew users see
the same user-facing feature set. -->

- Added configurable app hotkeys, including native AppKit handling while terminal panes have focus.
- Added saved first-message metadata for agent sessions and a copyable "View 1st Message" modal in active and previous session flows.
- Added terminal workspace background color settings and native pane-gap/background rendering.
- Added automatic Zed workspace syncing after zmux workspace switches, controlled by a setting.
- Added native main-window size persistence between launches.
- Added native terminal search bar rendering and focus preservation improvements for modal workflows.
- Improved sidebar sessions to default to last-activity ordering and keep agent-icon mode blank for iconless sessions until hover.
- Expanded command/workspace icon choices and kept the icon picker search fixed while the icon list scrolls.
- Removed T3 Code from default sidebar agents while preserving existing T3 session recognition.
- Improved Previous Sessions by using the search field for "Find Session" prompts and keeping the native full-window modal compact.
- Added Scratch Pad focus diagnostics to help trace terminal-first-responder focus steals without logging note text.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-04-28

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-04-28-16:00: Release notes must summarize the
