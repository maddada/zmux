# Changelog

## 9.0.0 - 2026-09-08

- New Features

  - Sign in to your Claude and Codex accounts from inside Ghostex: start a login, confirm the email, reconnect one that stopped working, and swap which slot an account sits in, without opening a terminal.
  - Star an account to keep it in the titlebar, where a small badge opens a panel showing how much of each limit you have used, how quickly you are using it, and when it resets.
  - Ghostex now finds Claude and Codex conversations you started outside the app and offers to import them, so your existing work sits alongside your Ghostex sessions.
  - Open a subagent's own transcript from the task card that started it, and page back through its history without leaving the chat.
  - Recall prompts you recently sent straight from the chat box, including ones a delayed send delivered while you were away.
  - Grok joins the agents you can chat with.
  - Drag a project or a group onto a Space to move it there, and drag the Spaces themselves to reorder them.
  - Codex sessions now report their token use, limit windows, credits, and request timing, and you choose which of those rows to show and in what order.
  - Choose whether web pages in Ghostex's browser follow your system appearance or stay light or dark.
  - Swipe with two fingers on the trackpad to move Back and Forward through the sessions and views you visited.
  - Open a table from a chat message full screen.

- Major Improvements

  - The chat box is a new, much lighter editor. Reference pills, find and replace, go to line, soft wrap, and full keyboard editing all stay, and chats no longer download a large code editor to show you a text box.
  - The model and effort picker is now its own window, so you can call it up from terminal view as well as chat, and your choice is retried automatically when the agent is busy.
  - The Resources panel lists every project on its own instead of bundling them into "Other projects", and you can close a session straight from the panel.
  - However you activate a session, Ghostex now reveals it in the sidebar: it switches Space, expands the project and group, and scrolls the session into view.

- Minor Improvements

  - The app's default chrome color is a neutral dark instead of the icy tint; colors you picked yourself are untouched.
  - Draft sessions sit at the top of the list, newest first, marked with a pencil.
  - Hand the draft you typed in chat over to the terminal view.
  - Long dropdown lists can be searched instead of scrolled.
  - The chat box now glides out of the way as you scroll the conversation and back when you stop.
  - More keyboard editing in the chat box, including deleting to the start or end of a line.
  - Queued prompts show the shortcut that edits them.
  - Agent dialogs such as /usage always offer their exit button, so leaving one never means switching to the terminal.
  - The message history marks beside a conversation are larger and easier to hit.
  - The browser pane menu now opens as a titlebar popup like the other menus.
  - Turn off the terminal model picker shortcut if you would rather the terminal keep that key.
  - Chat images no longer show a zoom cursor.
  - Session menu labels are capitalized the same way everywhere.
  - The web app gets the same new chat box and reveals activated sessions too.

- Stabilization

  - Agent finished and stopped notifications no longer show up twice in a row.
  - Codex's local commands now show their full output, thanks to banozz.
  - A rewind that works but cannot tidy the terminal keeps your draft and tells you, instead of dropping it.
  - Closing the last browser tab takes you back to Agents rather than leaving an empty browser.
  - The menu bar dropdown stays open when you switch to another app.
  - The active model is detected more reliably when the terminal and the picker disagree.
  - Double-clicking a prompt in Find resumes it even when the list scrolls under your cursor.
  - A project or group belongs to only one Space now, so it no longer appears twice in the sidebar or on your phone.

## 8.10.0 - 2026-09-07

- New Features
  - Sign in to several Claude or Codex accounts, switch a session between them, and let Ghostex move to the next account when one hits its limit. A setup guide walks you through each provider, and you can blur account emails when sharing your screen.
  - Diagrams written in chat messages or Docs now draw as pictures you can open full screen.
  - Dev Servers lists the local web servers your projects are running, with a titlebar button you can hide if you do not use it.
  - A minimap beside long conversations lets you jump back to any earlier turn.
  - Save a prompt you wrote straight from the chat into your Saved Prompts library.
  - Pick the model and the reasoning effort for Claude and Codex from the chat bar.
  - Browse the web servers running on a remote computer over SSH, inside Ghostex's browser.
  - Split the session you are on into a second pane on the right.
  - Mastra Code joins the agents you can launch.
  - Restart Ghostex from the app menu.
- Major Improvements
  - The terminal engine moves to zmx 0.8.1. Installing this version restarts your running sessions once. Agents come back automatically, but anything they had in flight at that moment is lost, so update at a quiet time.
  - Questions that used to appear only in the terminal now show up as cards in chat with buttons you can click: trust this folder, Codex dialogs, and the Grok, Hermes, and Pi permission prompts.
  - Long Codex transcripts open in a pager you can restore back to the chat view, and rewinding a conversation now works for Codex as well as Claude.
  - Chats you are not looking at release their memory against a budget, so keeping many sessions open costs noticeably less RAM.
  - Codex shows its local command output and its sub-agent activity in chat as they happen.
- Minor Improvements
  - Edit in the chat box with the keyboard: move the caret by word or line, reach the last queued message with Alt+Up, and use the usual text shortcuts.
  - Scroll continuously through models and effort levels in the picker instead of one step per gesture.
  - The chat box gets out of the way while you scroll the conversation and returns when you stop.
  - Context usage is shown as a percentage.
  - Notices, questions, tool runs, and activity rows share one card look across the chat.
  - A transcript you hand to another agent arrives as a named link instead of a bare file path.
  - The Resources panel lists sessions from every project, not only the one you are in.
  - The sidebar collapse, update, Back, and Forward buttons are one square family in the titlebar.
  - Terminal, browser, and editor panes follow the window's rounded corners.
  - Docs can reveal the file you have open, peek at the files list when you hover the expand button, and floats that list over a narrow pane instead of squeezing the page.
  - Docs uses the same palette as the Kanban board.
  - Settings previews the pairing QR code, and its search finds more of what is there.
  - The web app shows the same toasts as the desktop app and is served by its own `ghostex web` command.
  - Projects remember the session you were last on, and Quick Access reopens it.
  - The session list keeps the sections you collapsed.
- Stabilization
  - Restored terminals keep their soft wraps, so resizing the window reflows the text instead of leaving broken lines.
  - Sessions parked in the background stay attached and resize correctly when you come back to them.
  - Composer text is versioned, so the newest edit wins when the desktop, web, and phone apps are typing into the same session.
  - Arrow keys reach the agent list prompts that expect them.
  - A forked session no longer inherits an unbounded Codex history.
  - Codex sub-agent transcripts no longer set off agent hooks.
  - Command terminals for a remote project are created on that machine, and reconnecting recovers them.
  - Reading an agent's screen now takes a bounded slice of the terminal instead of the whole scrollback.

## 8.9.0 - 2026-09-05

- Major
  - Agent approvals start at Keep default. Claude and Codex no longer launch with permissions skipped; turn that on per app or per agent when you want it. Your existing choices are unchanged.
  - Quota, sign-in, and agent errors no longer lock the chat box. You see the error and can retry or switch models. Only screens that genuinely need an answer, like a sign-in dialog, still hold input.
  - Easy Connect installs itself with one click in Settings → Remote, instead of a `go install` command in a terminal. Pairing is now split into Connect a Phone, with the QR code, and Connect a Remote machine, with the code and SSH login the other computer needs.
  - First-run setup focuses on Codex, Claude, and Cursor, confirms each agent is connected before moving on, and offers skills as capabilities: Control Ghostex, Use your browser, Use your computer.
- Minor
  - Switching terminal tabs no longer reflows the agent's TUI. Only an on-screen chat view widens a session nobody is watching. This update does not restart your sessions.
  - Codex GPT 6 Astra joins the model lists, model rows are grouped under headings, and Claude's two Opus rows are listed separately.
  - A successful `/effort` or `/fast` change gets its own pill in the transcript, including Codex's Fast mode ON and OFF.
  - The model and options pills stay skeletons until a value is known, instead of showing the words Model and Options.
  - Codex's model picker works on a machine you are connected to remotely, so the phone and the web app can change it too.
  - A gxserver that fails to start offers Copy diagnostics on its toast, with the health probes, launcher log, and launchd state, minus tokens and paths.
  - Interrupting an agent twice no longer leaves you at a half-loaded shell.
  - Claude's "N skills available" notice is no longer drawn as a tool call.
  - The chat transcript's body text is easier on the eyes.
  - Tooltips wrap at a sensible width instead of stretching across the window, and the Terminal View preview shortens the agent's full-width rules.
  - Ghostex no longer quits a second after the Preparing Ghostex window on a first launch or after a Chromium runtime update.
  - A locally built development bundle no longer offers an update that would replace it with the released app.

## 8.8.0 - 2026-09-04

- Major
  - Pair a phone with Easy Connect: the new Mobile & Remote setup shows a code the Android app scans, Settings → Remote gains SSH access, Tailscale and paired-device cards in place of the tailcat panel, and saved machines are reached over an Easy Connect forwarder instead of a raw SSH host.
  - The Android app gets the matching setup flow (Welcome, connect, scan code, connected), a Can't reach checklist that names the cause of a failed connection, Tailscale SSH without a password, machine tabs with a cloud connect glyph and counts, and Delayed Send countdowns that tick from the phone clock.
  - Switch Account: a Claude or Codex session can be resumed under another account of the same agent family from the terminal action bar, the chat composer menu, or the sidebar card.
  - Antigravity CLI is a Chat View agent: its transcripts are followed, model and effort are read from the terminal footer, thinking stays visible as narration, its hooks are installed, and its own conversation names become session titles.
  - Only a terminal you are looking at sizes a session: hidden chat views and background clients rest at 200 columns, so agent CLIs stop truncating lines in Chat View and a hidden pane no longer pins the daemon narrow. Installing this release restarts every live zmx session once; agents resume from their saved commands.
  - Custom Views: add any number of named HTTP or HTTPS pages in Settings → Extensions, drag them into the order you want, and turn one off without losing its name and URL. Each enabled view becomes its own titlebar mode tab and opens in its own isolated page.
  - Codex model and effort are set from the chat pills: the pills list Codex's models, efforts and Fast mode the way Claude's do, and Ghostex drives Codex's own picker in the session terminal because Codex has no command form for it. Installing the hooks also adds a status line that names the model, so the pills are filled in before the first turn.
  - Chat View follows Claude Code's live work: the tool Claude is running right now shows as a card pinned to the bottom of the transcript, carrying the tool's own painted text and opening to the full call, and Claude's permission dialog is answered from chat with Yes or No. Claude's side panes no longer leak into the transcript, and its diff panel is closed again when nobody is watching the pane.
  - The context meter opens onto Claude's status line: a More details section groups Usage & cost, Context & cache and Session rows, including spend, rate limits, lines changed, prompt cache state and token counts. Star the rows you care about to keep them under the chat box, and drag them into the order you want.
  - A prompt Claude hands back comes back to the chat box. Pressing Escape just after a send returns the text to the composer, whether you pressed it in chat, in the terminal pane or on a phone, instead of leaving the message lost or reported as undelivered.
- Minor
  - The chat box is never locked. When a send is refused because input is held by another device, a question is waiting, or a mode switch is in flight, the draft stays editable and a red toast says why instead of the text box going read-only.
  - Settings → Remote stacks Easy Connect and Tailscale as expandable cards, so only one QR code is ever in front of you, and each path has its own on/off switch. Turning Tailscale off also hides it from the Mobile & Remote setup. Saved machines move to a compact grid and are edited in their own dialog.
  - A Codex session keeps the title Codex generates for it: Ghostex waits for Codex's own name and only steps in when that never lands, so a session no longer settles on the first few words of your prompt. A custom agent's default session name no longer blocks auto-naming either.
  - Dismissing a terminal notice in Chat View makes it stay dismissed; a banner that missed one screen probe used to reappear every few seconds.
  - Clicking a fork's earlier thread now opens it: a stopped ancestor is woken in place first, which keeps the fork family intact.
  - Sleep on a session card sends the running session to sleep instead of waking it.
  - nix-darwin computers find their own tools again: sessions keep the PATH their login shell builds instead of the app's, and Ghostex also looks in the Nix profile directories for `claude`, `bd` and `gx` (GitHub issue #118).
  - Queued prompts that Claude Code submits together no longer stay on screen labelled Queued, and the pane stops showing a stale working spinner after the reply lands.
  - Minimizing an Agents panel no longer nudges the first tab sideways or drops the panel's left edge line.
  - Usage analytics record which OS a phone or browser connects from, and which agent CLI a custom agent actually runs, instead of collapsing every custom agent into one bucket.
  - Product copy across the desktop, web and Android apps drops em dashes for punctuation that reads naturally.
  - Claude Code questions now stay in Chat View while background subagents work in the same session; previously a subagent's tool traffic retired the card within a second.
  - Claude's task list shows above the composer, context window usage appears in the composer, and a Claude statusLine command keeps the model and effort pills live.
  - Chat View retires terminal status rows by their first paragraph and transcript recency, approval cards no longer repeat the tool name, the context meter Compact button is simpler, option pill menus stay anchored while a choice loads, and the transcript selection toolbar stays one pill on mobile.
  - Cursor's Ready title ends the working spinner, custom agents built on Claude keep a stable identity, and disabled Antigravity or Claude hooks count as not installed.
  - Ghostex no longer bundles, downloads or symlinks the Beads `bd` CLI; install Beads on the machine and the Kanban board uses that copy.
  - Machine tabs count every session on the machine regardless of filters and hide idle awake counts, and Space swipe works across the whole sidebar page.
  - Tips & Tricks is refreshed for the current product surfaces, first-launch setup can finish when a project already exists and hands phone setup to Mobile & Remote, and product copy says computer instead of Mac.
  - The model catalog adds Cursor's Gemini 3.8 Flash and the Antigravity CLI lineup, the `ghostex sessions` mobile summary carries delayed-send deadlines and automation flags, and the Linux app syncs the X server before CEF parents into the embed host.
  - A Claude turn that finishes now shows the blue dot and plays the attention sound the way Codex does.
  - Split Right opens a session in a pane beside the focused agents pane from Advanced in its sidebar menu, on local and remote machines, the tabs bar above the pane can be shown even when the screen is not split, and a restart comes back on the pane and session you left.
  - Codex's options pill gains Plan mode, checked while Codex is actually in Plan mode, and Fast mode and Plan mode now share one Modes section.
  - Picker cards in chat start collapsed with their first two options side by side and expand when you click the title, answering one takes effect immediately and only returns with a reason if the answer did not land, and the Selected in terminal badge is gone.
  - Claude's "Resume full session as-is" row is answered with a single Escape.
  - Reasoning rows show their whole heading wrapped instead of one clipped line, the transcript stays pinned to the bottom as it grows, and the chat box's scrollbar appears only when the pointer is over it.
  - A session card shows a white dot on its agent icon while the chat box holds unsent text, and Switch Agent lists agents in the same order as the sidebar.
  - Session rows on a remote machine use the same spacing as the same project opened locally.
  - The new `ghostex resources` command prints the rows the desktop Resources panel shows together with the per-process sample behind them, and Clean RAM copies a diagnosis prompt built from that snapshot.
  - Sleep Inactive counts idle session daemons across every project rather than mounted panes, and a daemon belonging to another project's session is listed under that session instead of as an orphaned process.
  - The Tips warning about missing agent hooks opens Settings → Agents at the roster instead of an empty search, and only names agents you actually keep in the sidebar.

## 8.6.0 - 2026-09-02

- Major
  - The sidebar shows one machine at a time: machine tabs sit under Search, a remote tab's cloud icon connects or retries and explains a failure in its tooltip, right-clicking a tab hides the machine or opens its settings, and Add Project, Sort & Filter, Collapse All and Edit Machine now live in the More menu.
  - Spaces end with a built-in Other space that holds every project no Space claims, replacing the All Projects view on desktop, web and mobile.
  - Claude conversations can be rewound from Session Chat: every prompt has a Rewind to here button that drives Claude Code's own restore flow, the transcript then shows only the active branch, and the rewound prompt lands back in the composer for editing.
  - The Android app gains machine tabs and Spaces, a Web Preview that opens any port listening on the computer through the SSH connection with a picker of live ports, QR scanning to pair a tailcat machine from the desktop's Remote settings, and Hide from Sessions for machines you do not want polled.
  - Model, reasoning effort and Fast mode choices in the chat composer come from a published catalog that updates without an app release, and Codex sessions gain a Fast mode pill.
  - Sessions whose agent process dies outside Ghostex, including Quit Ghostex & BG Service, a crash or a reboot, now go to sleep instead of disappearing into history, keep their chat, and wake on the next launch.
- Minor
  - Native alert dialogs such as the paste-protection and close-terminal confirmations appear again instead of invisibly holding keyboard focus, thanks to banozz.
  - Codex hooks are now marked trusted when installed, so Codex actually runs them instead of showing Installed while silently skipping them, and Settings says when a hook update is required.
  - A session started from Handoff or Export is created as a draft, so Chat View is available immediately and, when your default agent view is Chat, it opens straight into chat with the handed-off prompt in the composer.
  - Forked Claude and Codex sessions no longer share the parent's identity, so the fork and its parent stop showing the same chat and title.
  - The Session Chat context menu adds Locate File on paths and Copy URL, Open in Embedded Browser and Open in External Browser on links, and Save Image now works for large images.
  - Sleep and Wake are only offered for sessions that are actually running or sleeping, and Sleep All, Wake All and Pop Out Pane skip stopped history rows.
  - Waking a session or opening a new terminal takes one probe instead of three, session listing no longer reloads the whole registry on every request, and long zmx operations no longer stall unrelated actions.
  - The sidebar reconnects on its own with backoff after a gxserver restart, and remote machines stop refetching a full snapshot for every stale update over SSH.
  - Tailcat connections from Android 11 and newer work again, connection failures show the real cause, and newly paired machines no longer need to reach the relay map before the first tunnel byte.
  - Bundled skills install without Node or npm on the PATH, the Ghostex CLI link refuses to overwrite an unrelated ghostex or gx command, and first-launch setup waits for the daemon before reporting hook status.
  - Claude status rows are retired against the transcript so near-duplicate lines no longer linger, a /compact typed in the terminal shows the compacting card, and a sent message no longer reappears as an unsent draft on the next start.
  - The new `ghostex ports` command lists every listening TCP port on the machine, and `ghostex rewind-session-chat` drives a Claude rewind from the CLI.

## 8.5.0 - 2026-09-01

- Major
  - Cursor is now a full Chat View agent: sessions read their model, context window, reasoning effort and Fast mode live off the terminal, thinking shows as an activity card, Cursor's own questions are answered inline with Space and Enter, and transcripts export like any other agent.
  - Remote machines can be reached without a Tailscale account: gxserver runs its own tailcat tunnel, owns its key and address, comes back automatically after a restart, and is set up from the Remote tab in Settings.
- Minor
  - Cursor, Grok, Hermes, OMP and Pi sessions now name the screen that is blocking the composer — a picker, approval, sign-in or editor — instead of silently swallowing the message.
  - Codex and Claude always launch with their unattended permission flag, so turning Accept All off no longer leaves them stuck on an approval prompt nobody can answer.
  - Resuming or forking a Codex or Claude session no longer replays a stale session id from an earlier one-time command.
  - Session notes are edited in the same Monaco editor as the composer.
  - File and skill references appear as pills in the mobile and embedded chat composers instead of raw Markdown, and copy back out as plain text.
  - Opening a file at a specific line in an already-running Code tab works again, and falls back to copying the path with a notice when it cannot.
  - A single click on the collapsed command pane expands it, and the double-click-for-a-new-terminal gesture now applies only once it is open.
  - Close After Done and Sleep Inactive only sleep sessions that are actually running, so pinned, tagged and favorited sessions are no longer swept away.
  - The sidebar has symmetric gutters, separators that run its full width, and a plain gap against the workspace in place of the stacked separator strip.
  - The mobile chat view can switch an unprompted draft session's agent and send Enter or a shifted option key without typing into the terminal.
  - The transcript no longer shows a second typing indicator while the agent works, since the pinned working strip already reports it.

## 8.4.0 - 2026-08-31

- Major
  - Session Chat now shows what the agent's terminal is doing right now: compaction and other live activity appear as a card pinned above the composer, stay visible wherever the transcript is scrolled, and clear on their own when the agent goes idle.
  - Codex sessions that open a chooser — model, effort, permissions, approvals, or any other numbered picker — now say so in chat with the choice on screen, instead of refusing your message with a generic "input box is not on screen" error.
- Minor
  - The `ghostex` and `gx` commands keep working after an app update; a packaged launch refreshes command wrappers that were still pointing at the previous install's binaries.
  - Close After Done sits beside Delayed Send in the session menus on desktop, web, and the terminal action bar, and both countdowns tick live instead of only moving when the session refreshes.
  - First launch asks whether the terminal view should use the full pane or match the chat width, and new installs now default to full width.
  - The agents tab context menu opens with Rename and Sleep for the session you clicked, above the scoped Sleep Right, Sleep Left, and Sleep Others actions.
  - File references in the transcript read as ordinary links, and composer reference pills show their full path in a tooltip rather than a native title popup.
  - Installed extensions show their author, and version labels are written the same way across the Store, your installed list, and Settings.
  - Hermes sessions running under a named profile are recognized again, so chat no longer refuses every send while the composer is plainly on screen, thanks to @banozz.
  - Agent commands that hop to another user or host, such as through `ssh`, no longer leave the agent CLI wedged in an editor at launch, thanks to @banozz.
  - Project Board `start-work` dispatches the worker into the project you name instead of whichever project was touched most recently, thanks to @banozz.

## 8.3.0 - 2026-08-30

- Major
  - Hermes Agent is now a first-class Session Chat agent, with its own transcript reader, model pill, welcome art, automatic session titles, hook allowlisting, and handoff hints.
  - Agent questions asked by Pi, Hermes, and oh-my-pi are answerable straight from the chat card, each driven through that CLI's own picker, alongside the existing Claude and Codex support.
  - Settings has a single Extensions page: the built-in features Ghostex ships sit above the extension store and your installed list, replacing the separate Customize page and the standalone Extensions window, and every menu, shortcut, and command-palette entry now opens it.
  - A remote machine's project Actions load in the sidebar and run in the desktop command pane, so remote work no longer has to be started from a terminal by hand.
- Minor
  - Session Chat can give the transcript its own width, and the terminal view can use the full pane, match the chat width, or take an independent width of its own.
  - Terminal notices can be answered with number keys, single-select questions submit as soon as you pick an option, and Claude's model-switch and paused pickers are answerable from chat.
  - The composer's model and options pills stay as loading placeholders until the agent's screen is actually readable, instead of flashing empty labels while a CLI is still starting.
  - Files and folders dragged from the desktop attach through their native paths, so local drops land as real attachments rather than unresolved names.
  - Composer reference pills stay atomic, wrap with their own text, and no longer leak into the message the agent receives; pasting long text into the composer is noticeably faster.
  - Empty draft sessions now stay until you delete or send them, instead of disappearing on their own.
  - New installs open with an ice-tinted app chrome and a lighter accent color, and Accent Color now also marks advanced rows in Settings.
  - First-launch setup finishes only when your first project starts — Escape and the close button no longer end it halfway — and its Skills step sets up the Ghostex CLI for you when a selected skill needs it.
  - Chinese, Japanese, and Korean input works properly in the terminal: the composition caret is drawn in place, and Backspace edits the composition instead of deleting text behind it.
  - Opening a file in Code from agent chat or the Agents Hub is queued until the editor is ready, instead of failing when the request beats the workbench.
  - Spaces respond to trackpad swipes, and the Space switcher and its overflow menu are rounder and easier to hit; Settings moved into the sidebar's More menu.
  - Prompt search no longer fills up with the title, commit-message, and sub-agent scaffolding turns that agents write into the same transcripts.
  - Kanban card conversation links display again on large shared boards, and jumping to a dead linked session resumes the agent conversation rather than an empty shell.
  - Custom agents keep their activity across identity updates and resume through their own CLI family.
  - Saved Prompts lets you change tags and favorites on prompts you already saved, not only while saving them.
  - Session Chat pins an agent-working indicator above the composer, so a running turn stays visible no matter where the transcript is scrolled.
  - Interrupting a Codex session no longer trips a hook-output error, because the Ghostex notify hook now returns the response Codex's Interrupt event accepts.
  - Long automation prompts stay inside their detail cards, chat surfaces no longer show stray browser focus rings, and child windows open centered on the main display.
  - The Terminal View button previews the agent's CLI on hover with a readable tail, and Summary mode shows its state as its own icon.
  - Markdown ordered lists keep the numbering the agent wrote instead of being merged into one run.
  - macOS 26 and later no longer crash the zmx daemon on exit, and Codex session files resolve correctly on macOS.
  - Android and iOS gain the custom transcript width toggle; on iOS the chat view loads reliably again and Send & Attach File opens the document picker as expected.

## 8.2.0 - 2026-08-28

- Major
  - Spaces let you organize projects into named working sets and filter each local or remote gxserver independently, while machine tabs make it quick to move between this computer and connected machines without losing each machine's selected Space.
  - New agent sessions can begin as durable drafts: choose the agent, model, effort, view, and first prompt before Ghostex launches a terminal, then recover the draft across desktop, web, and Android after navigation, reconnects, or crashes.
  - Forked conversations now appear as a family across Session Chat and Previous Sessions, with branch badges and an in-chat switcher that follows successor sessions without losing the shared transcript.
  - Arch Linux users now get an official, hash-verified `ghostex-8.2.0-linux-x64.tar.zst` package alongside the DEB and RPM downloads; its prefix-preserving layout installs Ghostex under `/opt` with the `ghostex` and `gx` commands on `PATH`.
- Minor
  - Session Chat preserves atomic file references in Monaco, keeps synced drafts until delivery is confirmed, restores unsent Saved Prompt drafts, shows clearer terminal readiness and refusal feedback, and presents compaction summaries and file-open paths more clearly.
  - Agent and remote-machine settings are simpler to scan and configure, terminal width can apply to command panes, and sidebar tooltip delay is adjustable down to instant display.
  - Docs can delete folders, style supported documents, and include temporary project files that were previously hidden.
  - Quick Access includes already-open projects and offers direct Close and Remove actions, while sidebar grouping, active-session state, and empty states stay consistent across local and remote sections.
  - Export Transcript is now Handoff, with a clearer agent action bar and shortcuts for carrying a session into another agent or conversation.
  - Extensions can open approved remote URL surfaces while preserving the extension host's launch, consent, and bridge boundaries.
  - Quitting the desktop app can shut down the full Ghostex service stack, including gxserver and its managed sessions, when you explicitly choose that option.
  - Usage analytics now has a complete public field inventory, immediate opt-out controls, and clear disclosure of the one-way hashed identity used to group a person's own machines; retired sidebar-layout dimensions are no longer reported.
  - Titlebar dropdowns keep their final row visible and return focus reliably, empty command-pane titlebars explain their controls, and action tooltips keep their intended spacing and hit area.
  - Android preserves sent drafts across navigation, adds a default agent-view preference, and uses the same Handoff terminology as the desktop and web apps.

## 8.1.0 - 2026-08-27

- Major
  - Extensions now run as first-class Ghostex experiences: install hash-verified packages from the redesigned Store, pin live titlebar launchers, and open extension views in the chat bar, terminal panes, popups, or app modals, with gxserver managing their processes and lifecycle.
  - Session Chat can attach multiple images, files, and whole folders as compact pills, walk dropped folders, open file references at the right line in Docs or Code, save transcript images to Downloads, and reach the agent's model, effort, delayed actions, transcript export, terminal handoff, and other session controls without leaving the conversation.
  - The embedded Ghostty engine moves to a substantially newer upstream build that cuts terminal memory by roughly 75% in its libghostty path, releases GPU resources for hidden surfaces, accelerates terminal string parsing, and improves Kitty graphics, clipboard, paste, Unicode, and IME behavior.
- Minor
  - Kimi, Campfire, OpenClaude, Command Code, and Devin join the built-in agent catalog with their own icons, status recognition, launch and resume behavior, and title cleanup; Settings can choose Chat or Terminal per agent and guides you through installing required hooks before a supported agent opens in Chat.
  - Agent terminals now share a focused bottom action bar across desktop and web, can be centered at a configurable width with horizontal and vertical padding, and can apply that layout to command and editor companion terminals too.
  - Previous Sessions shows transcript sizes, session rows surface note and Saved Prompt counts, and prompt search produces more relevant matches and clearer excerpts while ignoring empty Cursor projects and injected envelopes.
  - Session and project actions are grouped into clearer menus, app dialogs share one rounded modal shell, Docs rename uses that shell, and Quick Access, Add Project, missing-folder, extension, and titlebar panels have more consistent spacing and labels.
  - Parked browser, chat, command, and terminal runtimes restore more reliably, terminal writers are serialized to prevent dropped input, forks wait for their composers, F12 minimizes a focused command pane, and agent status stays tied to the session's actual agent.
  - Linux embeds its browser views as native Alloy child windows and stages the Code runtime on demand; Arch Linux is included through the official prefix-preserving `ghostex-8.1.0-linux-x64.tar.zst` package alongside the DEB and RPM downloads.
  - Android gains streamed macOS uploads, machine-level session menus, a kill-session action, Saved Prompt draft handoff, stable session collection ordering, and refreshed adaptive icons.
  - Anonymous usage analytics now report only coarse OS, feature, and count data, never prompts, paths, project names, or personal content, and can be disabled immediately in Settings > Privacy.
  - File drops can be saved as message markdown, terminal media opens with the operating system, browser home URLs persist with project snapshots, remote Saved Prompts keep their tag IDs, and transcript exports and project pickers correctly correlate concurrent requests.

## 8.0.0 - 2026-08-25

- Major
  - Every session can now carry a note — what you were doing, what to pick up next — attached to the agent's own conversation so it survives closing, resuming, and compaction, shown as a dot with a hover preview on the session row across the desktop, web, and Android apps, editable from the chat composer and the session menu, and readable from `ghostex session-note`.
  - Stashed Prompts is now Saved Prompts and gained colored tags, a tag rail with an Untagged filter, and a Go to session action that takes you back to the conversation a prompt came from; saved prompts stay attached to that conversation even after the agent compacts it, Alt+S saves what is in the composer, and Cmd+Alt+S opens the list.
  - Sessions you are not working on right now can be parked instead of closed: they leave the active list, collect in a collapsible Parked section at the bottom of their project, and keep their terminal — turn it on with Enable session parking.
  - Scheduled automations now resume the durable agent session they created instead of starting a new conversation on every run, so a recurring job keeps its context, and an agent can link the session it is working in to the board card it came from.
  - Session Chat shows the sub-agents Claude is running as their own strip with per-agent status and token counters, reports what the terminal is doing while a turn is in flight, and shows Claude's current permission mode as a pill you can change from the composer.
  - Prompt search opens as its own window over whatever you were doing, on Cmd+Shift+F, instead of taking over the focused terminal, and now finds text inside prompts you pasted into Claude Code rather than only the collapsed "Pasted text" marker.
  - Closing browser panes, chat surfaces, and terminals no longer leaves their renderer processes behind, so a long day of work releases memory instead of climbing into tens of gigabytes, and a chat surface you have not looked at for twenty minutes is unloaded and restored the moment you return to it.
  - First launch now walks through a six-step setup that skips the steps your machine already satisfies and ends by creating your first project and session, so a new install is usable without a trip through Settings.
  - Ghostex now has an extensions system with a Store and Installed browser, audited hash-verified packages, a titlebar launcher with pinnable live-badge icons, and view, chat-bar, terminal-pane, popup, and modal placements; the first catalog includes Storybook, Session Scratchpad, Lazygit, btop, Claude Usage, and Git extensions.
  - The Linux app draws the same integrated titlebar and window controls as Windows and macOS, and Linux downloads now include a portable `.tar.zst` archive for Arch Linux and other distributions alongside the DEB and RPM packages.
  - Ghostex ships a refreshed look: a new app icon, darker app chrome, one toggle and focus-ring shape across every control, restyled Kanban, Automate, and Settings surfaces, and new defaults for fresh installs — Session Chat as the agent interface, sessions grouped by project in the sidebar, and colored agent logos.
- Minor
  - Exporting a transcript now asks what to include first — the commands the agent ran, the patches it applied, and its reasoning — instead of always writing everything.
  - Trycua can be installed from Settings on Windows and Linux, not only macOS, and Settings shows the exact command the button runs.
  - Ghostex's bundled agent skills are consolidated behind one Ghostex CLI skill that covers orchestration, prompt-history search, and automations, and Project Board Beads is installable alongside it.
  - A session that runs `/compact` no longer gets stuck reporting work forever, so its queued prompts keep being delivered.
  - A Delayed Send now delivers the message staged in the chat composer instead of pressing Enter on an empty line and dropping it.
  - Large tool outputs no longer disappear from the middle of a transcript, and very long ones are shortened for display with the full text still one click away in the file.
  - Scrolling up in a chat keeps loading older messages on its own instead of stopping at a Load earlier button, and jumping back to the newest message animates instead of snapping.
  - A session forked with `codex fork` keeps its chat instead of freezing on the conversation it was forked from.
  - A terminal title that only repeats the working directory no longer becomes the session's name, and Grok's status prefixes are stripped out of generated titles.
  - Renaming a session from chat now shows the name the agent picked as its own card in the conversation, and a command you type in the composer reads as your own turn instead of a system line.
  - Claude's rotating status markers are recognized again, so live status shows while it works, and the messages it prints when it rejects a prompt — an unknown command, for example — now appear in the chat instead of the prompt silently vanishing.
  - Images in a transcript render as compact thumbnails with a copy-path action on the thumbnail and in the preview, and Codex's generated images show the same way.
  - Typing in the chat composer no longer loses the keyboard to the terminal behind it, and a chat draft is kept until the terminal confirms it was pasted.
  - Ghostex's own bundled command-line tools are recognized on Linux, so the CLI installs and repairs correctly there.
  - Sending a prompt now waits for the terminal to confirm it was queued, so a message can no longer be reported as sent while it was dropped.
  - The macOS titlebar zooms on a double-click, the traffic lights and project name sit at a comfortable inset, and workarea switch hotkeys work from every surface.
  - Resources now attributes an orphaned listener to the project that owns it.
  - Browser and editor panes wait ten minutes before sleeping instead of five, and an agent terminal that has never been prompted is never put to sleep.
  - Card association from an agent session contributed by [@banozz](https://github.com/banozz).

## 7.13.0 - 2026-08-22

- Major
  - Prompts can now be queued from the chat composer with Tab or a long press on Send, and Ghostex delivers one each time the agent stops — with every client closed, the phone locked, or the desktop app quit — so you can line up a session's next few turns and walk away; queued prompts can be edited, sent immediately, deleted, or reordered, the sidebar and the terminal show how many are waiting, and a session with a queue is never put to sleep automatically.
  - Your unsent chat draft now follows you between the desktop, web, and Android apps, and a newer draft from another device offers itself in a bar above the composer instead of overwriting what you were typing.
  - A new Find Prompts surface, opened with Alt+F or from the command palette, searches every prompt this machine has ever sent to an agent — across Claude Code, Codex, grok, Pi, OpenCode, and Cursor Agent — and resumes or forks the session it came from, on the desktop, web, and Android apps, sharing its index and starred prompts with `gx f` in the terminal.
  - grok sessions can now be opened in Session Chat, which follows its conversation, tool calls, and results as they happen, reads the model and reasoning effort off its statusline, and exports its transcript.
  - The project board now draws your own custom bd statuses as their own columns instead of showing those cards as fresh work, and columns can be added, renamed, and removed from the board itself.
  - Adding a project and cloning a repository are now one dialog: paste a repository or pick a folder, and a confirmation step shows where the clone will land, warns when the destination is already taken, and carries the branch name, main-only, and shallow options through to the clone.
- Minor
  - Cmd+K clears the focused terminal on macOS the way Ghostty's own binding does, dropping the scrollback and then the rows above the cursor so a half-typed command line lifts to the top, and Settings names the chord as reserved rather than letting a command take it.
  - The chat transcript is set in one deliberate type scale instead of four sizes with per-host line heights, and opening chat no longer flashes a lighter panel before the conversation appears.
  - Fenced code in a conversation is syntax highlighted, GitHub-style alerts render as callouts, and tables, file chips, and collapsible details read properly.
  - A reasoning turn is now headed by its own opening line instead of a column of identical "Thinking" rows.
  - The transcript shows what Claude Code is doing while it works — the status line it repaints on its terminal, and compaction with its progress — instead of staying empty until the turn lands.
  - An on-screen picker the agent puts up, such as Claude Code's resume chooser, can now be answered from the chat surface, and it delivers the row you actually chose.
  - The chat composer has a cut, copy, paste, and select-all context menu.
  - The model and effort pills no longer sit under a loading skeleton forever on a session whose agent names neither, or on a session that has stopped.
  - A message the agent CLI handles itself, such as `/usage` or `!ls`, is no longer reported as having failed to reach the agent.
  - One "Open links in" setting under Browser now decides where every web link an agent sends opens — terminal Command-clicks, chat links, and detected dev servers — replacing two settings that answered the same question with opposite defaults.
  - Agent menus mark every agent whose sessions can be opened in Session Chat, on the desktop and Android apps.
  - A custom agent built on a supported provider now keeps that provider's icon on its sessions and can be opened in Session Chat.
  - Browser tabs show the page's favicon in the sidebar, and a page that asks to close its own tab now closes it.
  - The project board can be filtered by tag alongside priority and estimate, and the choice follows you into every project.
  - Android loads Session Chat from assets bundled in the app, keeps Send Answer above the software keyboard, opens transcript search from the terminal overflow menu, and shows the sessions list with the same project rails, icons, tags, and grouping as the desktop sidebar.
  - Creating a terminal on a remote machine now checks what that machine's gxserver can actually do and says which side needs updating, instead of failing with the daemon's own error text.
  - Sidebar hover styling works again after switching back to the window, and tooltips dismiss when the pointer leaves.
  - A project ticket taller than the window now scrolls inside it instead of losing its top and bottom past the screen edges.
  - The Delayed Send dialog no longer sits low in its own window.
  - The Stashed Prompts search field takes focus when the dialog opens.
  - Browser Profiles is a normal Browser feature now rather than an experimental one.

## 7.12.0 - 2026-08-20

- Major
  - A new Export Transcript agent action writes the session's conversation to a markdown file — your messages, the agent's replies, the commands it ran with their output, and the files it changed — and offers to start a fresh conversation that already mentions the export, so you can hand a session's context to another agent without copying anything by hand. Available on the desktop, web, and Android apps and from the `ghostex` command line.
- Minor
  - Automatic sleep no longer retires a session you are looking at, including one showing its chat surface with the terminal parked behind it, or a session with a Delayed Send still waiting to fire.
  - Removing an installed agent hook or bundled skill now happens in Settings > Agents next to the control that installed it, with a remove action on each row and one Uninstall All for the whole set.
  - Remote settings now labels a saved machine's action as Install or Update depending on whether it already runs gxserver, and shows the installed version on the same row.
  - The project board now explains a refused action — closing an issue that still has open blockers or children, an impossible dependency, an issue id that does not exist — and offers the step that resolves it, instead of reporting the board as unavailable and telling you to reinstall Beads.
  - The Code tab is now disabled for remote projects, where it would have opened this machine's files rather than the remote ones, and offers to copy the remote path instead.
  - The session persistence warning in Tips now opens the settings page that actually holds that setting.
  - Desktop Control settings now reads the real accessibility and screen recording permission state instead of reporting it incorrectly.
  - The sidebar's scroll fade now settles correctly after a project or collection finishes animating open.

## 7.11.0 - 2026-08-19

- Major
  - Chat now tells you when the agent's terminal needs you, showing a notice for the CLI screen that is waiting and flagging a message the CLI swallowed instead of leaving it silently unanswered.
  - Back and forward navigation moves through recently visited sessions from the sidebar buttons or a hotkey, on both the desktop and web apps.
  - The chat composer can now attach project files by typing `@` and picking from the session's project, with the picker opening wherever the mention is typed in the draft.
  - The Monaco prompt editor now ships inside the macOS app, so Ctrl+G opens it on installed builds instead of quietly falling back to the machine's default terminal editor.
  - A new Command Pane Side setting docks the command pane as a full-height column to the right of the workspace instead of a strip along the bottom, remembering its own width per project.
- Minor
  - Programs running in the terminal can copy to the system clipboard again.
  - Switching a session from the terminal to chat now carries whatever you had typed into the agent CLI over to the chat composer, on the desktop and Android apps.
  - Pictures in a conversation can now be saved to disk from the chat image viewer.
  - Long thinking blocks are capped with an expand toggle, so a single reasoning dump no longer owns the whole transcript scroll.
  - An agent's background task notifications now read as one status row with its result, instead of a block of raw tags.
  - The chat composer no longer behaves like a code editor, and F1 opens its command palette instead of typing a stray character.
  - Sessions you are viewing from your phone are no longer put to sleep by the owning machine's automatic sleep sweep.
  - Reconnect on Android now replaces the dead terminal instead of reporting success while the exited process stayed on screen.
  - The Add Project dialog can create a new folder in place and start the project in it.
  - Renaming a Claude Code session from Ghostex now updates the sidebar card as soon as Claude confirms the new name.
  - Settings sorts the bundled agent skills into recommended and optional, adds a Ghostex Computer Use skill, and offers the one-time Cua Driver setup the machine-automation skills need.
  - First launch now shows a single setup flow that opens with the tutorial video, instead of a separate video window followed by setup.
  - Notifications stay attached to the Ghostex window instead of floating above whatever app you switch to.
  - Opening a link from a browser page in a new tab now reveals that tab's row in the sidebar, including background middle-click tabs.
  - Launching an agent session on a remote machine works again instead of reporting a failure and dropping the workflow prompt.
  - Resources now reports process memory the way Activity Monitor does and lists one row per dev server, so its totals stop being inflated.
  - Delayed Send in the web app now runs on the machine hosting the session, matching the desktop and phone apps.
  - Project bodies and sidebar sections animate open and closed again instead of snapping shut.
  - Chat no longer shows prompts that were revised or re-sent before the agent replied, so the conversation matches what the agent actually ran.
  - Sending a chat message to a resumed Claude session now answers its resume-usage prompt first, so the message reaches the agent instead of being swallowed as menu keystrokes.
  - Clicking a picture in chat now toggles between fitted and full size, zooming to the spot you clicked and panning by scroll.
  - Interactive prompt cards now ask one question at a time with numbered shortcut keys, a collapsible header, and a free-text answer row in the composer's place.
  - Sending a chat message scrolls it into view without leaving an empty gap above the composer.
  - Copying one of your own chat turns now includes its image references, so pasting it into another composer still attaches the same pictures.
  - The sidebar session filter menu gained a No tag row for isolating sessions that carry no marker.
  - Sessions from agents that use half-circle spinner glyphs now report working status correctly and keep those glyphs out of the session title.
  - The Docs pane in Manage now fills the full height of the pane and follows the shared app theme.

## 7.10.0 - 2026-08-17

- Major
  - Delayed Send is now owned by the machine hosting the session, so timers and agent-stop triggers keep counting down and still fire after Ghostex is closed or reconnected, including for remote sessions.
- Minor
  - Agent sessions set to open in Chat now start directly in Chat with the composer focused instead of briefly showing the terminal first.
  - Clicking inside a chat now moves keyboard focus there instead of leaving typed keys going to the terminal behind it.

  - Android chat now uses the full screen width and reserves Enter for new lines, keeping sending a deliberate tap.
  - Opening an existing conversation no longer flashes the new-session welcome screen while the transcript loads.

## 7.9.1 - 2026-08-16

- Major
  - Windows upgrades and same-version repairs now install without the extra already-installed confirmation and reopen Ghostex automatically.

    - The sidebar is simpler, with the Commands Pane launcher moved onto the Recent Projects header as a hover action.
  - Browser appearance
    - Chromium browser panes now default pages to Light mode, even when the hidden browser toolbar color-scheme control is not visible.
    - System, Light, and Dark browser appearance choices now update page `prefers-color-scheme` behavior in Chromium panes instead of only storing the menu value.

  - Agent hooks and recovery controls
    - Advanced Settings adds searchable Uninstall Hooks and Uninstall Skills actions for removing Ghostex-owned setup artifacts.
    - gxserver can uninstall Ghostex-owned hook entries from supported agent CLI configs without touching user-managed provider hooks.
    - Agent hook status checks prioritize Codex, Claude, and Pi first, then continue through the rest of the supported agent CLIs so setup status appears progressively.
    - Hook warnings now explain that automatic session naming, In Progress/Needs Attention state, and sleep/resume reliability depend on current hooks.
- Minor

  - Native pane focus follows the surface that actually owns keyboard input. Focused borders track the AppKit first responder, directional focus uses rendered pane geometry, and command panels plus project-editor companion panes avoid stale retargeting.
  - Sleeping panes behave like selected panes instead of empty gaps. Their tab chrome remains visible, placeholders show "Press Any Key to Wake", and normal key presses wake the sleeping terminal in place.
  - Sidebar tag filters can be reordered, hidden, disabled, and reset from Settings. Hidden or disabled tags are removed from active filtering so old filter state does not keep sessions invisible.
- Minor
  - Sparkle's titlebar update button now fades only while an accepted update is actively downloading.
  - App Shots is opt-in by default and marked as Beta in Settings.

- Improved sidebar Actions so each project can keep its own action list while worktrees inherit their parent project's actions.
- Improved the Ghostex CLI so running `ghostex` or `gtx` with no subcommand lists sessions in the same project order as the app, and zmx-backed resume can recreate a missing named session when possible.
- Improved the pet overlay with actionable status badges, a Go to Ghostex menu action, a Sleep Pet action, and an additional pet sprite.
- Made the floating prompt editor open faster after startup by warming the editor host before the first real prompt edit.

- Added opt-in Rich Prompt Editing with gte, including Settings UI, native install routing, environment injection, and zsh startup shims that keep gte in charge after shell profiles load.
- Added installed-app CLI proxying so terminal commands such as `ghostex --help` and `ghostex sessions` run the bundled Node CLI before the macOS app starts.
- Improved native command execution by normalizing GUI-launched process `PATH` values so background commands can find common developer tools.
- Improved terminal search keyboard behavior, centering, and neutral styling for embedded Ghostty panes.
- Added active-project names to the macOS title bar while keeping chat workspaces labeled as Ghostex.
- Added focused native pane-reorder diagnostics and rejected stale title-bar hits so bottom-edge terminal selection does not become pane dragging.

- Moved custom workspace color selection into the workspace Theme context menu with a recent-color palette, removing the separate workspace config modal.
- Improved empty Combined-mode Chats and project groups so they auto-collapse while empty, expand when sessions appear, and show static folder/chat icons instead of inactive chevrons.
- Improved Recent Projects styling to match normal sidebar group rows and show preserved session counts inline.
- Expanded Codex first-prompt hook installation to existing Codex profile homes so first-prompt auto-title capture works when `CODEX_HOME` points at a profile directory.
- Finished native-only cleanup by removing the retired VS Code extension/workspace webview sources from Storybook and TypeScript configuration.

## 1.4.5 - 2026-05-05

## 1.4.2 - 2026-05-02

- Fixed Sparkle update detection by publishing releases with a monotonic `CFBundleVersion` build number.
- Kept the native AppKit pane resizing changes from 1.4.1 available in the update feed.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-05-02

- Moved split pane resizing into the native AppKit terminal workspace so Ghostty and WKWebView panes resize from the same layout owner.

- Added a cyan Ghostty palette default to improve terminal color readability with the recommended ghostex-managed config.
- Added a local agent release skill for repeatable split commits, release notes, GitHub releases, and Homebrew cask publishing.
- Added Generate Name diagnostics across the sidebar, bridge, and controller paths so silent session-name failures are easier to trace.
- Fixed terminal title bars so long titles are measured from raw text and use available pane width before truncating.
- Improved attached IDE refocus timing so ghostex resurfaces faster when the IDE is already active or when activation retries succeed quickly.
- Hid bare agent status words such as `Working`, `Done`, `Idle`, `Thinking`, and `Error` from visible terminal titles.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-04-29

- Added terminal scroll multiplier settings for precision devices and discrete mouse wheels.

- Gated non-error native/sidebar diagnostics behind Debugging Mode and reduced high-frequency focus/title logging.
- Improved terminal close cleanup by terminating processes still attached to the closed terminal tty.
- Improved embedded terminal search behavior so Escape closes search before reaching terminal programs.
- Changed embedded terminal cursor rects to use the default pointer cursor instead of always showing the I-beam.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-04-29

- Improved previous-session search launching by routing modal input through the sidebar/native command bridge.
- Fixed agent wrapper process launch so interactive CLIs stay attached to the foreground terminal TTY and receive resize signals.
- Added agent wrapper debug logging for TTY/process details used to diagnose resize and child-process issues.
- Fixed native embedded terminal layout to step pane sizes to whole Ghostty character cells, including configured terminal padding.

- Added native main-window size persistence between launches.
- Added native terminal search bar rendering and focus preservation improvements for modal workflows.
- Improved sidebar sessions to default to last-activity ordering and keep agent-icon mode blank for iconless sessions until hover.
- Expanded command/workspace icon choices and kept the icon picker search fixed while the icon list scrolls.
- Improved Previous Sessions by using the search field for "Find Session" prompts and keeping the native full-window modal compact.
- Added Scratch Pad focus diagnostics to help trace terminal-first-responder focus steals without logging note text.
