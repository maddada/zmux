# Changelog

## 1.4.9 - 2026-05-07

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-05-07-08:01: Release notes for 1.4.9 must include
all commits after v1.4.8 so README, GitHub, Sparkle, and Homebrew release
metadata describe the same shipped behavior. -->

- Improved embedded code-server editor panes so VS Code panel/sidebar drag and drop keeps live hover and drop targeting while using CEF.
- Fixed embedded browser/editor pane teardown so closing a pane from the sidebar does not close the top-level app window.
- Improved project editor persistence so VS Code workbench layout survives app restarts without putting code-server into a fresh Chromium profile.
- Improved zmx session persistence so empty sessions attach directly, startup commands run only for new sessions, and inherited zmx session variables do not hijack app-managed names.
- Improved zellij session persistence so generated session names stay within provider limits and new sessions launch under the same name used for restart attach.
- Enlarged README screenshots for clearer GitHub documentation.

## 1.4.8 - 2026-05-06

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-05-06-19:47: Release notes for 1.4.8 must include
all commits after v1.4.7 so README, GitHub, Sparkle, and Homebrew release
metadata describe the same shipped behavior. -->

- Added embedded code-server editor panes so project groups can open a native CEF-backed code editor surface.
- Added project header controls for opening project-scoped browser panes and project editor panes from the clicked group.
- Added zellij as an opt-in terminal session persistence provider alongside tmux and zmx.
- Added a sidebar side setting so users can choose left or right placement from Settings, including startup restore and legacy side migration.
- Added modified-setting indicators with per-setting reset-to-default tooltips in Settings.
- Replaced native `title` attributes across sidebar controls with shadcn/Radix app tooltips and shared local brand icons.
- Improved project editor panes so middle-click closes the editor surface while preserving project diff stats and runtime sleep behavior.
- Improved code-server editor drag/drop by disabling native pane resize/header reorder interception while editor panes are visible and logging passive CEF drag diagnostics.
- Fixed right-side sidebar layout so the resize divider sits between the workspace and sidebar instead of on the outside edge.
- Fixed Combined-mode project groups so empty project groups remain expandable for editor cards while browser and non-project groups still auto-collapse.
- Removed versioned Sparkle release-note markdown files from the repository.

## 1.4.7 - 2026-05-06

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-05-06-03:12: Release notes for 1.4.7 must include
all commits after v1.4.6 so README, GitHub, Sparkle, and Homebrew release
metadata describe the same shipped behavior. -->

- Added persistent terminal session providers so terminal metadata, restore inputs, and provider state can survive app restarts.
- Added Chromium CEF native browser support with vendored CEF build wiring, persistent browser storage, and cookie flushing on app termination.
- Added shared Ghostty settings so terminal configuration can be reused across the native host and sidebar settings surfaces.
- Added native floating session status indicators for running, attention, and available session counts, including click-to-focus routing back into the workspace.
- Added a Configure Actions modal with readable action rows plus create, edit, and delete flows for sidebar project actions.
- Added Previous Sessions restore for archived terminal session records so restored sessions keep agent identity, first-message metadata, title provenance, favorites, and resume inputs.
- Filtered placeholder Previous Sessions entries so default titles such as `Terminal Session` and `Codex Session` are not saved as low-signal history cards.
- Improved Previous Sessions project restore by switching back to the original project, reviving Recent Projects entries, or recreating the project when needed.
- Fixed sparse Combined sidebar scrolling so empty/collapsed project lists stay pinned instead of rubber-banding or preserving stale scroll offsets.
- Fixed Combined-mode Chats grouping so the synthetic Chats group marker survives sidebar-store normalization.
- Improved native pane drag and reorder handling so hit testing stays scoped to pane headers while terminal/body interactions keep their expected routing.
- Improved terminal close cleanup by skipping redundant Ghostty close requests once a process has already exited.
- Adjusted native sidebar and Storybook layout so project panels can use the right edge rail without being clipped.

## 1.4.6 - 2026-05-05

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-05-05-05:01: Release notes for 1.4.6 must include
all commits after v1.4.5 so README, GitHub, Sparkle, and Homebrew release
metadata describe the same shipped behavior. -->

- Replaced native title-bar action controls with compact sidebar Actions dropdowns for project commands and Open In targets.
- Added explicit Open In choices for Finder, Visual Studio Code, and Zed, including brand icons and persisted primary target selection.
- Added removable Actions dropdown rows so configured project actions can be deleted from the same menu that runs them.
- Added custom workspace theme colors that tint the workspace dock, Combined-mode project headers, and active workspace sidebar theme surfaces.
- Moved custom workspace color selection into the workspace Theme context menu with a recent-color palette, removing the separate workspace config modal.
- Improved empty Combined-mode Chats and project groups so they auto-collapse while empty, expand when sessions appear, and show static folder/chat icons instead of inactive chevrons.
- Improved Recent Projects styling to match normal sidebar group rows and show preserved session counts inline.
- Expanded Codex first-prompt hook installation to existing Codex profile homes so first-prompt auto-title capture works when `CODEX_HOME` points at a profile directory.
- Finished native-only cleanup by removing the retired VS Code extension/workspace webview sources from Storybook and TypeScript configuration.

## 1.4.5 - 2026-05-05

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-05-05-02:22: Release notes for 1.4.5 must include
all commits after v1.4.4 so README, GitHub, Sparkle, and Homebrew release
metadata describe the same shipped behavior. -->

- Added native title-bar split controls for primary Actions and Open In commands while keeping empty title-bar space draggable.
- Added React-rendered title-bar dropdown menus for configured zmux actions and Open In targets, reusing the existing sidebar command and selected-IDE state.
- Improved terminal focus sync so passive layout/status updates no longer steal focus from the terminal or modal the user is actively typing in.
- Improved embedded Ghostty terminal color handling by removing inherited color-disabling environment keys at the native surface boundary.
- Added optional CEF prototype scaffolding for future Chromium browser panes while keeping the default WKWebView build path buildable without the Chromium SDK.

## 1.4.4 - 2026-05-04

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-05-04-16:01: Release notes for 1.4.4 must include
all commits after v1.4.3 so README, GitHub, Sparkle, and Homebrew release
metadata describe the same shipped behavior. -->

- Added Combined sidebar mode so native zmux can show one project group per project across all projects, while preserving Separated mode for the previous per-project layout.
- Added a Recent Projects drawer with fuzzy project/path search and startup cleanup for empty combined-mode projects.
- Added project context actions for opening project config, setting project theme, copying the project path, opening the folder in Finder, opening it in the selected IDE, and closing projects into Recent Projects.
- Improved native T3 Code runtime handling so fresh supervised runtimes are retained during startup/auth races, with explicit stop still available for recovery.
- Improved T3 thread changes by creating and syncing sidebar cards when the native host receives thread-change events.
- Fixed sidebar resize drags to use stable window coordinates so the sidebar does not jump while dragging.
- Added color-environment diagnostics for agent launches so monochrome CLI sessions can be traced to inherited terminal environment values.
- Added long-paste rename handling that summarizes pasted session text before syncing the rename into the agent CLI.

## 1.4.3 - 2026-05-03

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-05-03-08:14: Release notes for 1.4.3 must include
all commits after v1.4.2 so README, GitHub, Sparkle, and Homebrew release
metadata describe the same shipped behavior. -->

- Added an opt-in Browser Panes mode that opens browser actions as first-class workspace panes instead of Chrome Canary windows.
- Added native browser pane controls for address navigation, reload, DevTools, React Grab, profile selection, and browser-data import messaging.
- Persisted browser pane URLs, favicons, and browser-auto titles so sidebar cards and app restarts reflect the current page.
- Added native pane header drag-to-reorder support across terminal, T3, and browser panes without surfacing hidden sessions.

## 1.4.2 - 2026-05-02

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-05-02-11:33: Release notes for 1.4.2 must call
out the Sparkle build-number fix because installed apps compare
CFBundleVersion when deciding whether a feed item is newer. -->

- Fixed Sparkle update detection by publishing releases with a monotonic `CFBundleVersion` build number.
- Kept the native AppKit pane resizing changes from 1.4.1 available in the update feed.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-05-02

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-05-02-11:16: Release notes for 1.4.1 must include
all commits after v1.4.0 so README, GitHub, Sparkle, and Homebrew release
metadata describe the same shipped behavior. -->

- Moved split pane resizing into the native AppKit terminal workspace so Ghostty and WKWebView panes resize from the same layout owner.
- Removed the React workspace resize overlay and tests that no longer apply to native pane sizing.
- Removed whole-cell terminal body stepping so pane chrome and terminal renderer widths stay aligned during native resize.

## 1.4.0 - 2026-05-02

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-05-02-08:37: Release notes for 1.4.0 must include
all commits after v1.3.0 so README, GitHub, Sparkle, and Homebrew release
metadata describe the same shipped behavior. -->

- Added a standard native macOS app menu with About, Check for Updates, Settings, Services, Hide, and Quit.
- Added a setting to hide the native IDE title-bar attach button without disabling IDE attachment.
- Improved IDE attachment behavior so the floating Show IDE button raises or launches the configured IDE for the current workspace.
- Improved T3 runtime startup by rebuilding the local t3code-embed checkout only when source fingerprints or build output require it.
- Improved workspace dock clarity by dimming inactive project icons.
- Kept the local release workflow skill available on this machine while removing it from the public repository tree.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-04-30

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-04-30-03:37: Release notes for 1.3.0 must include
all commits after v1.2.0 so README, GitHub, and Homebrew release metadata
describe the same shipped behavior. -->

- Added Ghostty config actions and a recommended Ghostty config that includes zmux-managed color, cursor, font, scroll, and split-opacity settings.
- Added a cyan Ghostty palette default to improve terminal color readability with the recommended zmux-managed config.
- Added a local agent release skill for repeatable split commits, release notes, GitHub releases, and Homebrew cask publishing.
- Added Generate Name diagnostics across the sidebar, bridge, and controller paths so silent session-name failures are easier to trace.

- Improved attached IDE refocus timing so zmux resurfaces faster when the IDE is already active or when activation retries succeed quickly.
- Hid bare agent status words such as `Working`, `Done`, `Idle`, `Thinking`, and `Error` from visible terminal titles.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-04-29

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-04-29-09:31: Release notes for 1.2.0 must include
all user-facing commits after v1.1.0 so README, GitHub, and Homebrew release
metadata describe the same shipped behavior. -->

- Added terminal scroll multiplier settings for precision devices and discrete mouse wheels.

- Improved terminal close cleanup by terminating processes still attached to the closed terminal tty.
- Improved embedded terminal search behavior so Escape closes search before reaching terminal programs.
- Changed embedded terminal cursor rects to use the default pointer cursor instead of always showing the I-beam.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-04-29

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-04-28-06:27: Release notes for 1.0.4 must be
derived from the commits after v1.0.3 so README, GitHub, and Homebrew users see
the same user-facing feature set. -->

- Expanded command/workspace icon choices and kept the icon picker search fixed while the icon list scrolls.
- Removed T3 Code from default sidebar agents while preserving existing T3 session recognition.
- Improved Previous Sessions by using the search field for "Find Session" prompts and keeping the native full-window modal compact.
- Added Scratch Pad focus diagnostics to help trace terminal-first-responder focus steals without logging note text.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-04-28
