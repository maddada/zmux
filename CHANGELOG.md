# Changelog

## 1.0.3 - 2026-04-28

<!-- CDXC:Distribution 2026-04-28-16:00: Release notes must summarize the
user-facing changes added after v1.0.2 so GitHub, README, and Homebrew release
metadata describe the same shipped behavior. -->

- Added workspace configuration for dock name, theme, Tabler icon, and uploaded image.
