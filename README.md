# Ghostex

A native desktop app for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and any other CLI agent. Run them side by side, review their work, and keep going from your computer or your phone.

Ghostex is built for developers who keep multiple agents and terminals alive at once. It combines low-RAM Ghostty terminals, a native Rust/GPUI interface, Chromium CEF browser panes, and Mobile (iOS/Android) session access in one workspace.

## Install

### macOS

The Homebrew cask installs the Apple Silicon build automatically.

```bash
brew trust maddada/tap && brew install --cask maddada/tap/ghostex
```

Latest download: [macOS Apple Silicon DMG](https://maddada.com/download/macos-arm64).

### Windows (WSL2 beta)

> **The Windows app is a beta intended for WSL2 workflows only and may still have bugs.** Install and use it with an existing WSL2 distribution; native Windows shell workflows are not the intended setup yet. Please report problems on the [Ghostex Discord](https://discord.gg/df7b3G92CS).

Latest downloads: [Windows x64](https://maddada.com/download/windows-x64) · [Windows ARM64](https://maddada.com/download/windows-arm64). Ghostex manages its terminals, gxserver, and Source editor inside the selected WSL2 distribution. The Kanban board needs the Beads `bd` CLI installed inside that same distribution (see the Kanban section below).

Starting with 7.0.0, Windows installations receive automatic updates from GitHub Releases. If you installed a 6.x Windows beta, install the 7.0.0 Setup EXE once to move to the new updater; later releases can be downloaded and applied from inside Ghostex.

### Linux

Latest downloads: [Linux DEB](https://maddada.com/download/linux-deb-x64) · [Linux RPM](https://maddada.com/download/linux-rpm-x64) · [Arch Linux tarball](https://maddada.com/download/linux-tar-x64).

#### Arch Linux and other distributions

The portable `ghostex-<version>-linux-x64.tar.zst` on the
[latest release](https://github.com/maddada/Ghostex/releases/latest) works on any x64
distribution that ships the Chromium runtime libraries. It is a prefix-preserving tree, so
extract it at the filesystem root — that installs `/opt/ghostex` and puts `ghostex` and `gx`
on your `PATH`:

```sh
sudo tar -xpf ghostex-*-linux-x64.tar.zst -C /
ghostex
```

On Arch the runtime dependencies are `gtk3`, `nss`, `nspr`, `mesa`, `libxkbcommon`,
`alsa-lib`, `at-spi2-core`, `libcups`, `libdrm`, `libxcomposite`, `libxdamage`,
`libxrandr`, `libxshmfence`, `pango`, `cairo`, `fontconfig` and `wmctrl` — most are already
present on a desktop install. Ghostex does not bundle Chromium; the first GUI launch
downloads the browser runtime into your cache directory.

### Android

Use the Android app to connect live to your Ghostex agent CLI sessions. APKs are in GitHub Releases.

#### Click the button to get the app:

[![Download Android APK](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android-APK-3DDC84?logo=android&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/maddada/Ghostex/releases/latest/download/ghostex-android.apk)

### iOS

The testflight for this app is running through our Discord: https://discord.gg/df7b3G92CS
Please join and post in the iOS channel to get the app.

## Gallery

### Terminal-backed Chat GUI!

You can't click on images in the terminal, editing long prompts really sucks, and typing is slow when you're sshing on a slow connection. But the terminal is more powerful than chat interfaces and gets all the features first.

The Solution is here! Render the same session as a CLI or a Chat GUI.
Toggle between the two with a single hotkey or click!

<img width="400" alt="48382" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6db91470-b859-4a09-873b-45e0947560ac" />

### Built-in IDE (Optional extension)

Loads on demand for working with markdown, reviewing code, and checking PRs. <br/>
Supports all extensions. Sleeps when not in use to save resources.

<img width="1200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/986fbece-d0de-4739-8515-f3c2a7437b92" />

### Split your terminals and use keyboard hotkeys to jump between them in the Agents view

The same configurable hotkey flow you're used to from terminals like Ghostty and cmux. <br />
Use Cmd/Ctrl + T for a new terminal, Cmd/Ctrl + D to split, and configurable shortcuts to move between panes.

<img width="1200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c92c5ec9-0021-42fb-9628-0cee62c48e86" />

### Supports all of the popular Agent CLIs

Ghostex works with Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, Pi Agent, Gemini, and all other Agent CLIs. <br/>

### Embedded Chromium Browser

Comes with Annotations, Chrome Devtools MCP for Agents, Profiles.<br />
/ghostex-embedded-browser-use lets the agent control your embedded browser tabs.

<img width="1200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce9fbe6b-8c2b-41f1-88f6-67d8254846e5" />

### Rich Prompt Editor with Ctrl+G

Edit your agent prompts with full hotkeys support and image previews! <br />
No more uneditable "[Pasted 50+ lines]" text! Press F1 for all commands.

<img width="2048" height="1221" alt="2026-06-23_CleanShot_15-47-56" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f1db19e-20c2-456c-bb91-8dc3309b4c4b" />

### Kanban board based on beads (Optional extension)

Put all your thoughts here then let an orchestrator agent manage subagents to tackle them<br/>
(Ghostex supports cross Agent CLI orchestration, your Claude Code can launch and steer Codex agents!)

The board drives the [Beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) `bd` CLI installed on the
machine that runs the project: macOS, Linux, a remote machine, or your WSL2 distribution.
Ghostex does not bundle it. Install or update it there with the official installer, or let
the board's "Install or Update Beads" action run it for you:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gastownhall/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

<img width="1200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85543937-85f1-4171-b2d0-6ee7264beddd" />

### Docs view for working with HTML/MD/Excalidraw! (Optional extension)

#### Collaborate with your agent on HTML prototypes, mockups, and explainers! Annotations system included!

<img width="3456" height="2066" alt="2026-06-30_Ghostex_04-58-31@2x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/694293c1-139c-4269-8304-21ac561a01fd" />

#### Full markdown editor + annotations that you can send to your agent to collaborate!

<img width="3456" height="2066" alt="2026-06-30_Ghostex_10-03-18@2x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41ab6a04-2a99-43d6-a22b-60d824f468fb" />

#### Or even ask the Agent to draw an .excalidraw UI or diagram in the /docs folder:

<img width="3456" height="2066" alt="2026-06-30_Ghostex_03-11-59@2x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/629ca0bb-b249-49e4-85d6-1834fcea1e88" />

### Search Previous Sessions from All Agent CLIs in 1 place

Fuzzy search in all your previous sessions accross agents by typing a few words from your prompts
Press enter to resume that session! Lots of filters available. Start it from the sidebar or run `ghostex find / gx f` to start it

<img width="3456" height="2066" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85bfd614-d352-4f30-8501-f2a47d001f88" />

Also see list of all previous sessions from all agents by title/tag/last active so you can resume any of them

<img width="3456" height="2066" alt="2026-06-30_Ghostex_10-53-36@2x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d774329-6a5d-4d8d-98e7-34fd2613dd8b" />

### Inbox Based Agent Management

This optional inbox moves work beyond individual sessions. <br/>
Organize around threads and worktrees, focus on one project or see every project together, then snooze or settle threads as needed.

<img width="3456" height="2072" alt="Inbox-based agent management in Ghostex" src="media/readme/ghostex-inbox-agent-management.png" />

### Extensible Architecture (client apps <-> gxserver daemon <-> zmx persistence)

The client/server split allows your to install just the gxserver daemon on any remote machine then control the agents on that machine from any client device <br />

Supported clients: macOS, Linux, Windows WSL2 beta, Android, TUI (based on herdr)<br />
Supported hosts: macOS and linux (tested on ubuntu x64 and arm64)<br />

<img width="3326" height="1514" alt="2026-06-12_Google Chrome_23-43-07@2x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecc84149-a9fc-4ec8-a387-af5ce35aa7be" />

### Cross-agent orchestration built in

Agents can launch other agent session using the "ghostex" cli command.
You can ask Claude Code to launch Codex sub-agents and send prompts there/read their output.
Write your own skills that use the /ghostex-cli skill.

<img width="3454" height="2068" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9332bb11-1e99-4be5-9016-e4cc14638cea" />

### Web app source

The browser app lives in [maddada/ghostex-web](https://github.com/maddada/ghostex-web),
pinned here as the `apps/web` submodule. Initialize it before running the web commands:

```sh
git submodule update --init -- apps/web
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run web:typecheck
bun run web:build
```

Run these commands from the Ghostex root. The web app uses this checkout's shared UI,
contracts, and Bun dependencies. Commit and push web changes inside `apps/web` first,
then commit the updated submodule pointer here.

### Building from source

`bun run start` builds and launches the desktop app; `bun run build` only packages it. Both compile
the desktop crate (`apps/desktop/`, Rust 1.95.0 pinned by its `rust-toolchain.toml`) and the gxserver
crate (`server/`, your default `rustup` toolchain). Besides Bun, Rust, CMake, Ninja, and Zig 0.16, local
Rust builds require **sccache**:

```sh
brew install sccache
```

Both crates set `rustc-wrapper = "sccache"` in their `.cargo/config.toml`, so every `cargo` invocation
run from inside `apps/desktop/` or `server/` (the build scripts, `bun run release:preflight --cargo`,
rust-analyzer, your shell) compiles each dependency crate once and replays it from the local disk cache
afterwards, including after `cargo clean`. If sccache is missing, cargo fails with
`could not execute process 'sccache'` instead of silently building without it.

Cache location and size come from the user-level sccache config, because the sccache server is a
daemon that reads its configuration once at startup. Create
`~/Library/Application Support/Mozilla.sccache/config` (Linux: `~/.config/sccache/config`) with:

```toml
[cache.disk]
dir = "/Users/<you>/Library/Caches/Mozilla.sccache"
size = 21474836480 # 20 GiB; the default is 10 GiB
```

Then `sccache --stop-server` so the next build starts a server with the new settings, and check with
`sccache --show-stats` (it prints the cache location and max size; run it after a build to see hits).

The root `.cargo/config.toml` uses `line-tables-only` debug information for development builds
and their derived test profiles. This keeps file/line backtraces while reducing compiler output;
local-variable debug information is omitted. Incremental compilation keeps its existing settings.

On macOS, `python3 tooling/clean-build-caches.py` previews cleanup of a fixed list of generated
Rust, Zig, Xcode, and Android caches. Add `--apply` to clean, or `--install` to register a user
LaunchAgent that checks daily at 04:30 local time and at login. It removes trees unchanged for
14 days, or the oldest eligible trees above a combined 10 GiB cache budget, after at least six
hours without changes. Build locks, detected compiler activity, open files, and Git tracking
checks protect active work. This is a cache budget, not a hard limit on the entire checkout.
The latest scheduled result replaces `~/Library/Application Support/Ghostex/build-cache-cleanup/last-run.json`.
Time Machine snapshots and backup settings are not part of this maintenance job.
