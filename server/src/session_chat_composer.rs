CDXC:SessionChat 2026-08-26:
POSITIVE evidence that an agent CLI's input box is on screen and accepting
input, as opposed to the negative evidence session_chat_notice.rs collects.

The two are not the same question and cannot be answered by one detector. A
notice rule says "this specific screen — a trust dialog, an expired login, a
usage limit — is known to eat input". Silence from that catalog is not proof
that a composer exists: a CLI that is still booting, painting an auth screen we
have no rule for, or sitting on a dialog shipped after our last catalog update
looks exactly like a healthy idle agent to it. Every one of those swallowed a
chat message, and the user only learned about it from a delivery-failed banner
minutes later.

So this module asks the opposite question and requires an answer: WHERE is the
composer? Each supported CLI paints its input box with chrome that is stable
across versions and survives the zmx plain capture verbatim, and that chrome is
what a signature matches. Three outcomes, and the middle one is the whole point:

  - `Ready`    — the composer's own chrome is on screen.
  - `NotReady` — the agent HAS a known signature and it is absent, so something
                 else owns the screen. Refuse the send.
  - `Unknown`  — no signature for this agent, or the screen could not be read.
                 FAIL OPEN: every caller proceeds, because a detector that
                 cannot see must never be the thing that blocks a message.

Signatures were measured on 2026-08-26 against live CLIs, in three states each
(just launched, trust accepted, one message exchanged). Two rules came out of
that measurement and are load-bearing:

  - Scan the WHOLE visible capture, not the bottom rows. opencode paints its
    composer MID-SCREEN on a fresh start and only migrates downward after the
    first reply, and Claude/pi/omp all sit above a user-customizable statusline
    whose height this daemon cannot know. Nothing here may index from the
    bottom row.
  - A marker glyph alone is never a signature. codex's trust dialog draws its
    selected option with the same `›` its composer uses (`› 1. Yes, continue`),
    and copilot's draws `❯ 1. Yes` with the same `❯`. Every marker match is
    therefore filtered against the numbered-option shape, and most are further
    required to sit inside the frame the composer draws around itself.

A blocking notice always wins over a matched signature: cursor keeps its
answered trust dialog scrolled above a live composer, and grok paints its
composer while the start menu is still up, so "the box exists" and "the box is
what the next keystroke reaches" are different claims.

"What is actually in the terminal", for a client that just got `composerNotReady`
back from a send.

It is a separate endpoint rather than a payload on the error because
`DomainStateError` is `{ code: &'static str, message: String }` and nothing
else, built with struct literals at 169 sites across this crate; widening it to
carry evidence would touch every one of them to serve one caller. `rpc_error`
has the same fixed shape on the wire.

It is also not `/api/readSessionText`, which is the whole-history consumer: that
call serializes the entire scrollback (measured at 686 KB on a working session)
and caps it, where this one wants the last thirty lines and the verdict that
goes with them.
