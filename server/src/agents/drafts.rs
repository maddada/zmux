/*
CDXC:Drafts 2026-08-28:
A DRAFT is a real, durable gxserver session row whose agent CLI is running in
the background but which has never received a user prompt. Every new agent
session created from the sidebar starts this way, so trust / login / upgrade
screens surface while the user is still typing, and so the row is visible on
every client instead of only on the machine that created it.

The whole feature hangs off ONE marker: `runtimeSettings.draftStatus = "draft"`.
It is written at creation (`GxserverCreateSessionParams.draft`) and REMOVED —
never set to a second value — the moment the first user prompt actually reaches
the agent. A promoted draft is byte-for-byte an ordinary session; there is no
"was a draft" state to reason about anywhere downstream.

This module owns the marker, the promotion choke point, the draft-derived
display title, the agent list the composer's "Agents" section renders, and the
agent switch itself. Everything else in the daemon asks here rather than
testing the key.

CDXC:Drafts 2026-08-29 (drafts are durable):
A draft is never thrown away on its own. It survives navigating to another
session, sleeping, and daemon restarts, whether or not anything has been typed
into it, and leaves the sidebar by exactly two routes: the user deletes it, or
it is promoted. There is no navigate-away discard and no boot-time sweep of
empty drafts any more — an empty draft is a session the user made on purpose.

/*
The TERMINAL-DIRECT half of the promotion choke point: a user who ignores chat
and types straight into the agent's pane. It has two signals, in order of how
much they actually prove.

1. `promote_draft_on_prompt_evidence` — an agent hook that says, in so many
   words, that the user submitted a prompt. This is the signal we want, and for
   every agent whose hooks Ghostex has installed it is the one that fires.

2. `promote_draft_on_first_activity` — the first working/attention transition,
   for agents with no hooks, where a terminal title is the only evidence there
   is. A title cannot distinguish "the user prompted me" from "I am booting":
   Codex's startup spinner paints exactly the same working title (see
   `default_activity`). The daemon already has a policy for that — layer 1 of
   CDXC:AgentScreenDetection — and drafts lean on it rather than inventing
   a second one: `arm_draft_launch_activity_suppression` re-arms the launch
   window on EVERY draft provider start, so a boot spinner is folded back to
   idle and never reaches this function with a timestamp.

Both are deliberately keyed on "this row had NO `lastActiveAt` and is about to
get one" rather than on the presence of a timestamp in the update:
`compute_activity_update` carries the session's existing `lastActiveAt` forward
on every idle transition, so the timestamp alone says nothing about whether the
agent was ever prompted.

CDXC:Drafts 2026-08-28 (stranded quick projects):
`/api/createQuickAgentSession` creates a throwaway workspace before it creates
the draft that lives in it: a project row marked `launchSettings.isQuick`, whose
`path` is a real directory `create_quick_project_params` made under
`~/ghostex/chats`. Deleting the draft therefore leaves TWO orphans behind, not
one — an empty project row in the sidebar and a directory on disk — so the
removal path runs this afterwards.

The directory delete is the destructive part of the feature, so it is guarded
four ways and every guard must pass:

  1. the project is marked quick (the same `isQuick` flag the creator writes);
  2. the project has NO sessions left at all, so nothing can still be using it;
  3. the path is a real directory and NOT a symlink, checked through
     `symlink_metadata` so a link is never followed to its target; and
  4. the path's parent, CANONICALIZED, is exactly the canonical
     `<home>/ghostex/chats`, and the leaf name matches the exact
     `<timestamp>-<kind>-<suffix>` shape the creator builds.

Canonicalizing both sides is what makes guard 4 real rather than cosmetic: it
resolves `..` segments and symlinks before the comparison, so neither a crafted
project path nor a swapped-in link can name a directory outside the quick-chats
parent. A path that fails any guard is LEFT ON DISK with a warning — the row is
still cleaned up, because removing a stranded row destroys nothing, but nothing
outside that one directory is ever deleted on a guess.

CDXC:Drafts 2026-08-28 (agent switching):
`/api/switchDraftAgent`. A draft holds no conversation, so this needs no
confirmation and destroys nothing: forget the agent identity the old CLI
published, rebuild the launch plan through the SAME resolution
`/api/createAgentSession` uses (so a switched draft is indistinguishable from
one created with the new agent), and get the new CLI running.

CDXC:Drafts 2026-08-28 (live-pane switching):
"Get the new CLI running" has two shapes, and which one runs is decided by the
provider probe — never by a failure.

  * The pane is ALIVE (the common case: the user is looking at the draft they
    just opened). The switch then happens INSIDE that pane and the provider is
    never touched. Zsh launches the agent from a one-shot startup hook and
    keeps its initialized login shell; other shells use `<setup>; <agent CLI>;
    exec $SHELL -l`. Interrupting the CLI returns the same pty to its login
    shell, where the new agent's launch line can simply be typed.
  * The pane is MISSING (a slept or never-opened draft). There is nothing to
    reuse and nothing to interrupt, so the rewritten row is started the normal
    way. This is the wake path, not a fallback.

Killing and restarting the provider — what this endpoint did until 2026-08-28 —
is what made all four reported switch defects: the desktop's attach client
exits with the pane, and the exit poll closes the tab, which drops chat-mode
membership and DESTROYS the CEF chat page. That page is where the user's unsent
composer text lives (its 2s draft-sync debounce never gets to flush), and its
teardown is the visible chat → raw terminal → chat flash. Do not reintroduce a
kill here.

The refusal on a promoted session is the point of the whole endpoint being
draft-only: once a prompt has reached the agent, its transcript, resume plan,
and stored conversation id all belong to that agent, and rewriting the row
would strand every one of them.

The keystrokes an agent switch types into a draft's LIVE pane, in the order a

Three interrupts, not one: every chat-supported CLI reads a single Ctrl+C as
"cancel this turn" and only a repeat inside its own short window as "exit", so
one would be swallowed. The burst spans 300ms — comfortably inside the second
those CLIs measure — and the third interrupt's spacing simply folds into the
shell settle that follows it.

The command and its Enter are separate writes for the reason every server-side
writer of an agent pty keeps them separate (see SESSION_CHAT_CLEAR_INPUT_SETTLE_MS
in `session_chat_send`): a submit that coalesces into the body's stdin chunk is
inserted as literal text instead of running it.
