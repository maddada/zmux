CDXC:SessionChat 2026-07-31:
Session Chat send path (upstream chat spec §7/§8 port). The agent is a TUI, so sending is
writing bytes to its pty via `zmx send` stdin. The spec's measured discipline is
preserved verbatim: a Ctrl+U/Ctrl+K clear burst sized by the 2N-1 law, a
bracketed-paste body with ESC sanitized and newlines normalized to CR, and a
SEPARATE Enter write (a trailing \r inside the paste burst is read as newline
text and the message stays staged). What is NOT preserved is the blind 500ms
settle that used to precede that Enter: the Enter now waits until a screen
capture proves the composer actually took the body, and is never written when
the body is provably absent (CDXC:Clipboard below). A per-session
queue serializes sequences: each send owns the input line from its clear
until its Enter fires. HTTP handlers enqueue and return immediately.

CDXC:Clipboard 2026-08-24:
Why the Enter is closed-loop. The old sequence wrote the paste body, slept
SESSION_CHAT_SUBMIT_DELAY_MS, then wrote a bare "\r" with nothing checking
that the composer had taken the body. Claude Code ingests a multi-KB paste
asynchronously — it paints "Pasting text…" and only later collapses the body
into a "[Pasted text #N +M lines]" placeholder — and under machine load that
ingestion takes LONGER than 500ms. Reproduced deterministically 2026-08-23
with a 69-line / 4.6KB message: the bare Enter submitted an EMPTY composer,
the body arrived afterwards, and the user's message was silently lost because
it remained stranded in the terminal composer. zmx transport was byte-perfect
at that size, so the race is purely TUI ingestion time versus a fixed delay.

The fix is to watch the screen instead of the clock: settle briefly (so a
paste that already landed costs no extra latency), then poll captures until
the body is provably on screen. A send whose body cannot be proven present is
ABORTED without an Enter — losing the send with an error the user sees is
strictly better than submitting an empty turn and dropping their text.

/*
Pi's cursor_ask_question renders pi-tui selects (ctx.ui.select): ↑/↓ move the
highlight (wrapping), Enter commits, Esc/Ctrl+C cancels — no digit shortcuts
and no skip. Questions show ONE AT A TIME, so the groups for question N+1 only
land after question N's Enter; the queue's per-group pacing covers the repaint.
A question that allows a custom answer appends one "Type a custom answer" row
after its options, and committing that row opens a one-line input
(ctx.ui.input) that submits on Enter. An optionless question shows that bare
input directly. Cancelling any question ends pi's whole question loop, so an
unanswered question emits the cancel and nothing after it.

Hermes' clarify panel numbers every row: in single-select mode a digit (1-9,
then 0 for the 10th row) SUBMITS that choice directly — and in batch
(multi-question) mode it locks the active question's answer and auto-advances
to the next unanswered one, so the same digit sequence drives both layouts.
The row one past the last choice is "Other (type your answer)": its digit
switches the composer into freetext mode, where typed text + Enter submits
(or locks, in batch mode). Multi-select rows are checkboxes — digits TOGGLE
and Enter confirms; checking Other routes through freetext the same way.
There is no skip key and Esc is not bound to the panel, so an unanswered
question simply stops the key plan and leaves the panel to the terminal.

Submit tab whenever there is more than one question or any multi question).
The cursor starts on the `recommended` row (default 0, clamped) and ↑/↓ move
it WITHOUT wrapping; rows are the options in order plus a trailing
"Other (type your own)" row. Single-select Enter picks the row and
auto-advances (submitting a single-question dialog directly); Enter on Other
opens a custom-answer prompt that submits on Enter. Multi-select Space
toggles, and the plan advances with Tab instead of Enter because Enter on the
Other row would re-open the prompt. The final Enter confirms the Submit tab.
Esc cancels the whole dialog, so it is only sent for an unanswered

CDXC:SessionChat 2026-08-22:
Answering an on-screen picker (Claude Code's resume-usage chooser today): type
the chosen row's NUMBER, and nothing else.

This used to walk the highlight with arrow keys and confirm with Enter, which
always answered row 1. Measured on a zmx pty: `ESC [ B` written into that picker
does not move the highlight at all, so every walk was a no-op and the trailing
Enter committed whatever was already highlighted. The digit both selects and
commits — no Enter, no settle, nothing to pace. Same behaviour, same fix, and
same reason as Claude's AskUserQuestion selector above.

One verbatim write: no clear burst and no bracketed paste, because this is a
keystroke for a dialog that owns the input line, not text for a composer.

CDXC:AgentScreenDetection 2026-09-04 DECISION:
The permission prompt is the one picker whose keys are an arrow walk plus
Enter instead of a digit (user: "Enter for Yes and down arrow then Enter for
No"); `SessionChatTerminalPicker::answer_key` derives the walk from the
highlight in the answer-time capture, and this still writes it verbatim.

Invariant preserved from the upstream chat spec: each sequence owns the input line from its
clear until its Enter fires. One worker task per session drains jobs
serially; a cancelled generation skips queued jobs at dequeue AND aborts the
remaining steps of an in-flight job before its next write/sleep. A failed
zmx write aborts the rest of its sequence so a dangling Enter can never
follow a body that was not delivered. Must be called from within the tokio
runtime (HTTP handlers are).

CDXC:SessionChat 2026-08-24:
"Each sequence owns the input line" only holds if EVERY server-side writer to
that pty goes through here. Until this date several did not — the first-prompt
auto-title job, the manual "generate name" job (which writes a Ctrl+U draft
kill!), delayed sends, the raw `/api/sendSessionText` + `/api/sendSessionEnter`
endpoints, and the draft-handoff BEL — and they interleaved with in-flight send
sequences (measured: an auto-title write landed 70ms after a corrupted send,
because the auto-title job is triggered by the FIRST user prompt, i.e. exactly
while that prompt is still being delivered). They all enqueue now, and a writer
whose bytes must not be split apart (text → settle → Enter) enqueues them as ONE
job, because separate jobs may be separated by somebody else's job.

The screen watch that stands between a paste body and its Enter. It settles
once (so a paste the TUI already took costs nothing extra), then polls captures
until one of three things is true: the body — or the TUI's collapsed paste
placeholder (`[Pasted text …]`, `[Pasted Content …]`, `[paste …]`, … — every
supported agent collapses large pastes, each with its own spelling) — is on
screen, the deadline passed, or the send was superseded. "Pasting text…" is the TUI saying ingestion is still running,
which buys one deadline extension rather than an abort.

Claude, Codex and Grok verify only the live composer after its old draft was cleared.
They require evidence before Enter, including when capture fails. Other agents
retain their existing whole-screen watch and unreadable-capture behavior.

CDXC:SessionChat 2026-08-24:
Standalone terminal-draft capture for the `/api/handoffSessionChatDraft`
endpoint, as a QUEUED job.

This used to run the handshake directly, on the reasoning that the stash
marker's `create_new` open already excludes a concurrent chat send's preserve
step and that a view switch never races a send from the same client. Both
halves were wrong. The marker only stops two CAPTURES from overlapping; it says
nothing about the rest of a send sequence, so the handoff's editor invocation,
which makes the CLI stash and CLEAR the composer, could land between another
sequence's paste and its Enter and turn that send into an empty-line submit.
And the desktop fires this on every terminal→chat view switch, which is
emphatically not serialized against the sends that same client just made.

Riding the queue cannot self-deadlock: the only caller is the HTTP handler, and
the in-worker draft capture (`SessionChatSendStep::PreserveTerminalDraft`) calls
`run_terminal_draft_capture` directly rather than coming back through here, so
nothing ever enqueues onto the queue it is currently draining.

CDXC:Drafts 2026-08-18:
Terminal → chat draft transfer for every host. A user who typed into the agent
CLI and then lands on the chat surface, by tapping the toggle or because the app
auto-switched a terminal-started agent into Chat, must find that text in the
chat composer instead of stranded behind the parked terminal. The capture uses
the agent's prompt-editor handshake, which parks the draft in Saved Prompts;
this reads that row back and (when this capture created it) removes it again, so
a transfer leaves no residue in the user's Saved Prompts list.

Grok Build binds Ctrl+G to its Tasks pane, so its capture opens the editor through
the verified command-palette handshake in session_chat_grok_draft.rs.

/*
CDXC:Drafts 2026-08-30:
The prompt-editor handshake only works when the agent CLI inherits the session
shell's environment, where the launch script points $EDITOR/$VISUAL at
`ghostex prompt-editor`. An agent command that hops to another user or host
(`ssh -tt qawwi@localhost … hermes`, seen live 2026-08-30) starts the CLI
outside that environment: the CLI resolves its own editor instead (on current
macOS the prompt_toolkit fallback chain lands in pico via /usr/bin/nano), the
response file is never written, and the 16s wait ends with the TUI wedged
inside that editor — which then makes every send fail composer detection.
Nothing about such a session can answer the handshake, so the capture is
skipped up front and the draft stays in the parked terminal, the documented
loss-safe failure mode of this endpoint.
