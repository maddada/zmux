/*
CDXC:Telemetry 2026-08-26:
`POST /api/recordClientEvent` — the desktop app's loopback ping and, since
2026-09-03, the mobile app's hello (forwarded by `ghostex client-hello` over
SSH). This is the ONLY way a client process contributes to analytics. The
desktop, web, and mobile apps never talk to PostHog; they hand gxserver a
two-field body and gxserver decides whether anything is sent.

The trust model here is "none". The body is parsed defensively, only the
events listed in `CLIENT_PING_EVENTS` are accepted, and every property is
re-validated against the same taxonomy every server-side emitter goes through.
Anything that does not fit is dropped silently with a debug log — the caller is
fire-and-forget and never reads the response, so there is nothing useful to tell
it, and an error status would only tempt someone into adding a retry for
telemetry.
