/*
CDXC:AgentScreenDetection 2026-08-23:
The sub-agents Claude Code is running, which exist ONLY on its terminal
screen. It paints them as a block pinned below the statusline:

      ⏺ main
      ◯ general-purpose       Trimming unused imports in workspace_ter… 11m 58s · ↓ 155.4k tokens
      ◯ general-purpose (+1)  Launching board_gxserver.rs split           11m 2s · ↓ 76.0k tokens

Nothing about this reaches transcript JSONL, so a chat surface projecting the
transcript cannot show it at all — the user is told "the agent is working"
while three agents are working, and has no way to see what they are doing or
how long they have been at it. That is what this module recovers.

`⏺` is the SELECTION marker, not a status glyph: it rides whichever row the TUI
has selected, so the header wears `◯` the moment a subagent is picked. Every
test here is therefore positional, never glyph-based (see `split_fleet_row`).

The header row is the block's anchor and NOT one of the agents: `main` is the
agent the user is already talking to, and the chat view IS its output. Only the
rows below it are reported.

Two readers share this parse. This one turns the block into the fleet strip;
session_chat_terminal_activity.rs asks only where the block STARTS so it can cut
it off the screen before reading the status line, because a fleet row and a
status line are indistinguishable once the selection marker moves.

What changes and what does not decides the publish rate. `same_fleet` compares
the roster AND the token counters, but never the clocks: a clock moves every
second and would cost a frame per second, while the counters move only when an
agent actually did something. The clocks tick client-side from `detectedAt`
instead, which is why that timestamp is minted with the seconds it belongs to
and never carried forward — pairing a fresh reading with an older anchor would
make the client count the same interval twice.
