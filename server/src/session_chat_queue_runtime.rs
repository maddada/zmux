/*
CDXC:SessionChat 2026-08-21:
The scheduler half of the Ghostex chat prompt queue. `session_chat_queue.rs`
owns storage, the endpoints and the frame carriage; this module owns the clock
that decides WHEN a queued row is allowed to reach the agent.

The daemon owns this decision rather than any client, so a queue drains with
every client closed, the phone locked, or the desktop app quit.

Shape is deliberately `delayed_sends.rs`'s: a 1s tick, a non-working stability
window tracked per session, a guarded claim so two ticks cannot double-fire, and
restart recovery that never silently re-sends. The differences are the readiness
rule and the drain rate:

  - Ready = the session is idle, or sits in the attention a hook's Stop
    entered (`attentionSource: turnComplete`) with no question/approval card
    pending, AND the chat transcript lifecycle is not `Working`, held for
    SESSION_CHAT_QUEUE_STABILITY_MS.
  - Every other `attention` NEVER releases the queue. A prompt fired while the
    agent sits on a permission/approval prompt would be swallowed as the ANSWER
    to that prompt. Late delivery is harmless; early delivery corrupts a turn.
  - ONE prompt per idle window. Delivering the head makes the agent work again,
    so the clock restarts from zero after every attempt and row #2 waits for the
    next stop. This is never a "drain the whole queue" loop.
  - An input-blocking notice or unresolved quota, authentication, or agent error is not a delivery opportunity: the head
    row is marked `failed` with the notice title and the drain stops until the
    user retries or deletes it. The text is never lost. Queue eligibility uses
    `session_chat_notice.rs`'s own predicate, NOT `severity == error`: a trust
    dialog or a first-run setup screen is only catalogued `Warning`/`Info` and
    would still eat a prompt as the ANSWER to itself.

Cost discipline: only sessions that actually hold a pending row are considered,
so a daemon with no queues anywhere does one indexed SQLite query per second and
nothing else. Transcripts are never walked for a session with an empty queue.

    Claude Code's resume-usage picker owns the input line when a large session

    as-is") before typing, which was wrong twice over: the summary-vs-full
    trade-off is the user's to make, and whenever the walk missed, the message's
    own trailing Enter confirmed the HIGHLIGHTED row instead — silently
    compacting the conversation the user was continuing, with nothing to show
    for it but a delivery-failed banner.

    So the send refuses instead. The same capture that proves the picker is up
    caches the notice carrying its rows, and publishing it puts the answer
    picker in front of the user on every subscribed client. Only an ANSWERABLE
    state stops a send here: the catalog's other blocking dialogs still go

    THE chat half of the draft promotion choke point. Both callers reach the

    scheduler — so clearing the marker here covers every Ghostex-delivered first
    prompt, and it happens only after the bytes were accepted: a send refused by
    the composer gate or by zmx returns above and leaves the row a draft.
    (The terminal-direct half lives in `agents/drafts.rs`.)

    Option commands are carved out of BOTH halves. `/model` is delivered through
    this same function, and the dropdown that sends it is the one that will host
    the draft's own Agents section — so promoting on it would let a user destroy
    their draft's agent switcher by picking a model in it. The carve-out has to
    cover the terminal churn those bytes cause as well, which is why the
    non-promoting branch re-arms the draft's launch suppression window instead
    of doing nothing: the command's spinner is then folded back to idle exactly
    like a startup spinner, and cannot promote the draft through the
    activity-based half a second later.

CDXC:SessionChat 2026-08-21:
The sidebar's queued-prompt badge reads `queuedPromptCount` off the presentation
projection, NOT off the chat frame — the sidebar renders every session from that

otherwise idle session produces no other delta, so without this publish the badge
would only appear whenever some unrelated event happened to fire.

CDXC:Drafts 2026-08-28:
`/api/setSessionChatDraft` rides the same publish, which is what keeps a DRAFT
session's sidebar title following the user's typing on every client: the draft
display title is a presentation overlay read from `session_chat_drafts`, so the
delta this schedules is the only thing that republishes it.

Every queue mutation and every scheduler delivery already funnels through
`broadcast_session_chat_queue_state`, so the delta is published there rather than
at each call site. Same shape as `delayed_sends::publish_session_change`: one
short sequencer-locked section that projects, allocates the revision and
broadcasts, so revision order and broadcast order stay identical.
