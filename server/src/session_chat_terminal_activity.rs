/*
CDXC:AgentScreenDetection 2026-08-22:
Live work the agent CLI reports ONLY on its terminal screen, before the same
text reaches the transcript. Claude Code replaces a current-status line as it
works:

    ⏺ Removing temporary examples

It also reports a small set of meaningful states under other markers:

    ✻ Waiting for 1 dynamic workflow to finish
    ✻ Cooked for 46s · 1 shell still running

The client keeps each general status change as a transient reasoning row, then
lets the authoritative transcript replace it when JSONL catches up. A running
shell stays as one bottom activity row only while it remains on screen.
Claude's compaction is the structured-progress variant:

    ❯ /compact

    ✶ Compacting conversation… (1m 1s)
      ████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 49%
    Tip: Use /btw to ask a quick side question without interrupting Claude's…

For a minute or more the chat surface could say nothing better than "the agent
is working", because a transcript projection cannot see a progress bar. Worse,
compaction is the one operation whose whole point is that the conversation the
user is reading is about to be REPLACED — so a bare typing indicator is not
just uninformative, it hides the single most consequential thing happening.

This is deliberately NOT a terminal notice: nothing is wrong, nothing is
blocked, and there is nothing to answer. Both variants render in the transcript
where the work is.

Parsing is narrow and evidence-only. `⏺` owns Claude's general status rows;
other star markers are accepted only for explicitly understood states. The
percentage and elapsed clock are read off the screen or omitted; neither is
ever estimated.

        authority here — `PreCompact` is deliberately unregistered and a

CDXC:AgentScreenDetection 2026-09-02:
One physical screen row with its layout kept. `normalized_screen_lines` throws
the indentation away, which is right for every marker scan but wrong for the
`⏺` row: Claude wraps a long status at the terminal width and paints the rest
on rows indented by two spaces, and a scan that reads only the marker row
publishes a label cut mid-sentence. The client showed that cut prefix next to
the transcript's full sentence for the rest of the session, because a prefix
never text-matches the sentence it was cut from. Keeping `indent` and
`after_blank` lets the detector re-join exactly the wrapped rows and nothing
below them.

CDXC:SessionChatTerminalActivity 2026-09-03:
Only rows that are physically contiguous with the `⏺` row are part of it. A
blank row ends the status even though what follows is indented the same way,
because Claude paints everything that belongs to the turn under that bullet
with the same two-space indent:

    ⏺ Found a lead in the daemon log: the visible claim arrives, then a hidden
      claim follows within the same second.

      Running cd /Users/madda/dev/_active/Ghostex; rg -n "zmx_c…
      ⎿  $ cd /Users/madda/dev/_active/Ghostex; rg -n …

      Ran 6 shell commands

The in-flight tool row, the collapsed "Ran 6 shell commands" summary, and a
second paragraph of the message are indistinguishable by layout. Joining past
the blank once swallowed the tool row into the status, which then never
matched the transcript's sentence and produced a fresh near-duplicate for
every tool that followed. Stopping at the blank makes the label the message's
first paragraph: always a prefix of the transcript text, so the client can
retire it by prefix and never needs to guess what the indented rows below were.

CDXC:SessionChatTerminalActivity 2026-09-04 WHY:
A tool call is recognised by its `⎿` output gutter, not by its bullet. Claude
paints the in-flight tool row both as `⏺ Dumping other live Claude screens…`
and as `  Running cd …` (same row, bullet absent), so a detector keyed on the
bullet saw the tool appear and vanish with the paint, and the client card
blinked once a second and pushed the transcript up and down with it. The row
directly above the gutter, walked back over its wrapped rows, is the tool
whether the bullet is drawn or not. What sits above a gutter is a tool only
when it is a bullet row or an indented row: the spinner's `⎿ Tip:` and a
prompt's `⎿ Referenced file` hang under marker and prompt rows and are not.
