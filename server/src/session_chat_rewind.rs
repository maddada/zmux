/*
CDXC:SessionChat 2026-09-02:
`/api/rewindSessionChat` drives Claude Code's OWN rewind flow, in the session's
terminal, exactly the way a human drives it: type `/rewind`, walk the prompt
list up to the chosen prompt, press Enter, pick the option whose label is
exactly `Restore conversation`, press Enter again. There is no file to edit and
no API to call: the rewind lives in the CLI's in-memory conversation, and the
transcript only records it later, when the next prompt is appended with the
rewound leaf as its `parentUuid`. So the terminal IS the interface.

Driving a TUI blind is how keystrokes end up in the wrong dialog, so nothing
here is written on faith. Every step is followed by a screen capture that must
prove the expected dialog is up and the expected row is highlighted before the
next byte goes out, and any capture that disagrees aborts the drive with Escape
instead of continuing. The prompt the caller named is matched against the text
the TUI itself is showing on the highlighted row, so a list that is one row off
(a transcript row Claude counts differently, a rewind somebody did by hand in
the terminal) is refused rather than silently rewinding to the wrong turn.

The whole sequence runs as ONE job on the per-session send worker
(`SessionChatSendStep::DriveSessionChatRewind`), for the reason
CDXC:SessionChat states: a queued prompt landing between the
Up presses would type into the rewind dialog. It also means an interrupt that
bumps the session's send generation aborts the drive at its next step.

On success the target's `parentUuid` is recorded as the session's pending
rewind (session_chat_rewind_state.rs) so the chat readers hide the rewound rows
immediately, before the transcript can confirm anything.
