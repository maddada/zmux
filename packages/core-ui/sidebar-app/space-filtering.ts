CDXC:Spaces 2026-08-27:
A Space is scoped to the gxserver that owns its projects, so every Space-aware
value in the sidebar is keyed by SECTION rather than by machine alone: the local
Projects section and each remote machine section each have their own Space set,
their own Space row, and their own selection. These two builders are the single
place those keys are minted, so the persisted selection map
(`selectedSpaceIdBySectionKey`), the dnd sortable ids, and the Space-editor
modal payload cannot drift apart.

CDXC:Spaces 2026-09-02:
The one built-in view is "Other" (packages/shared/sidebar-spaces-other.ts): the
last button of every Space row, showing exactly what no user Space claims. It
has a reserved id rather than being "no selection", so a section is always
filtered by something and the persisted selection is never ambiguous.

CDXC:Spaces 2026-08-27:
Membership is stored on collections ("groups") and ungrouped projects only.
Everything else is derived here:

- a collection is in the Space when its id is a member collection id;
- an ungrouped project is in the Space when its project id is a member id;
- a project inside a member collection is in the Space (inheritance, with no
  per-project exclusions);
- a worktree follows its PARENT project's effective visibility and can never be
  assigned on its own.

Member ids that resolve to nothing are tolerated on purpose: gxserver prunes
deleted collections and re-grouped projects from its own copy asynchronously, so
a client that treated an unknown id as an error would flicker rows out of a
Space the moment a project moved.
