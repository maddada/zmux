// Session chat composer (upstream chat spec §1.1/§11.6 port). Enter sends by
// default, hosts can reserve it for newlines, Escape interrupts, the IME guard swallows
// composition Enter, ArrowUp/Down recall draft history, and Alt+ArrowUp in an
// empty composer pulls the nearest queued prompt back in to edit. Typing a
// line-leading "/" opens the slash-command picker (per-agent catalog):
// ArrowUp/Down highlight, Tab/Enter complete, Enter on an exact match sends,
// Escape dismisses the picker without interrupting. A "$" token opens the same
// picker over the session's skills and an "@" token over the project's files;
// both read the token under the caret (see session-chat-composer-trigger.ts),
// so they open wherever in the draft the mention is being typed. Every picker
// row carries `data-chat-picker-option`, which keeps the highlighted row's
// fill out of the dark chat theme's button flattening (packages/core-ui/styles/chat.css)
// — without it the keyboard selection moves invisibly.
//
// Layout (§1.1): input row, then a footer row — session identity/options on
// the left, with Attach, Maximize and Send/Stop on the right. Styled with
// shadcn tokens to sit under the shadcn chat conversation.
//
// Maximize lifts the whole field onto a centered overlay (see
// `.ghostex-chat-composer-maximized` in packages/core-ui/styles/chat.css) so long
// prompts can be edited without scrolling a 160px-tall input. The field keeps
// its place in the React tree while maximized — only its box changes — so the
// monaco instance, caret, undo stack and pending attachments all survive the
// toggle.
