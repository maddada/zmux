CDXC:AgentScreenDetection 2026-08-23:
The sub-agents Claude is running, lifted off its terminal screen and put where
the chat can see them. gxserver parses the block the CLI pins below its
statusline (server/src/session_chat_agent_fleet.rs); nothing about it reaches
transcript JSONL, so without this the chat can only say "the agent is working"
while three agents are working.

It stands directly above the composer and OUTSIDE it, deliberately. The queue
strip lives inside the composer container because a queued prompt is part of
what the user is about to say; this is the opposite — work already underway,
owned by the agent, that the user cannot edit. Two strips, two containers, no
competition for the same row shape.

Rows lay out on ONE grid rather than each flexing on its own, so every task
starts at the same x no matter how long the names above it are, and every token
counter ends on the same edge. The name track sizes to the widest name and
stops; every cell is therefore rendered even when empty, because a missing cell
would shift that row's remaining columns out of the shared alignment.

A narrow pane drops whole columns instead of squeezing the task into nothing —
counter first, then clock, then name — because the task is the only part that
says what is actually happening. Those steps are container queries in chat.css;
the only thing this file owes them is a `title` that still names the agent after
the name column is gone.

Every row's clock ticks LOCALLY from `detectedAt`, which gxserver mints with the
seconds it belongs to. It republishes a fleet only when the roster or a token
counter moves, never for a clock, so without interpolating here the times would
sit frozen between the samples that actually changed something.
