// Session Chat prompt queue + cross-client composer draft.
// Canonical wire types shared by gxserver (Rust mirror in
// server/src/session_chat_queue.rs), the shared React chat components
// (packages/core-ui/chat/), and every client host. Re-exported from ./session-chat and
// ./gxserver-protocol so consumers keep a single import surface.
// All values must stay plain JSON: they cross the /api/events websocket, the
// CEF bridge, the mobile bridge, and the gpui remote-machine proxy.

CDXC:SessionChat 2026-08-21:
gxserver owns a per-session queue of prompts the user wrote but does not want
delivered yet. A server-side scheduler releases ONE row each time the agent
stops, so the queue drains with every client closed, the phone locked, or the
desktop app quit. Rows are plain text: the composer already interpolates
attachments into the text as "[Image #N](path)" / "[File #N](path)" before it
queues anything, so the queue stores no attachment state.

NAMING COLLISION, READ THIS TWICE: `SessionChatMessage.queued` is a DIFFERENT
thing. That flag means the agent CLI's OWN internal queue (Claude Code's
`queue-operation` rows) is holding a prompt the user already sent with Enter,
and it renders inside the transcript. THIS file is Ghostex's queue, which lives
above the composer and which the agent has never seen. Never reuse
`SessionChatMessage.queued`, and never render these rows in the transcript.
*/

/**

 * `sending` — the scheduler claimed this row and is delivering it right now.
 *             Clients render it busy and refuse edit/reorder/delete on it.
 * `failed`  — delivery was attempted and did not succeed, or the session is in
 *             a blocking terminal state. Draining STOPS at a failed head row
 *             until the user retries or deletes it; the text is never

CDXC:Drafts 2026-08-21:

on another device shows what was already typed. Pushed on blur / leaving the

replacement for a host's own local draft cache.

Conflict rule: never clobber. A client that receives a draft with a newer
`updatedAt`, different `content` and a different `originClientId` shows a
one-line "Newer draft from another device: Use / Dismiss" bar above the
composer instead of overwriting a non-empty local composer.

CDXC:SessionChat 2026-08-21:
`queue` and `draft` ride on GxserverReadSessionChatResult and on the
snapshot / replaced / state frames. They are NEVER on `appended` frames, which
only add transcript rows and must stay cheap.

Their omission semantics DIFFER from each other, and `draft` is the odd one out
relative to everything else in session-chat.ts:

  queue — PRESENT (even as an empty array) is the daemon capability probe. A
    daemon that predates this feature omits it, and a client that sees it
    omitted hides every queue control instead of calling endpoints that will
    404. When present it is AUTHORITATIVE, head first, and replaces the
    client's list wholesale.

  draft — an OMITTED draft means "unchanged / nothing on the server", NOT
    cleared. This is the opposite of the `prompt` / `terminalNotice` rule,
    where an omitted field on a frame that can carry it means cleared. The
    difference is deliberate: those fields describe server-observed state that
    genuinely goes away, whereas the draft is text the USER TYPED. Clearing a
    local draft just because an old daemon (or a frame built before the draft
    was written) never sends the field would silently destroy their words. To
    clear a draft, write an empty `content` through /api/setSessionChatDraft —
    an explicit empty string, never an absent field.
