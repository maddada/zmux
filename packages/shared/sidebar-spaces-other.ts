CDXC:Spaces 2026-09-02:
The built-in "Other" Space. Ghostex has no "All Projects" view any more: the
LAST button of every Space row is Other, and it shows exactly the groups and
ungrouped projects that no user Space claims.

This module is the single definition of that rule. It is deliberately pure and
dependency-free — no React, no DOM, no core-ui types — because the mobile app
mirrors it VERBATIM. Anything that would make the desktop, web, and mobile
sidebars disagree about what "Other" contains is a bug; change this file, then
copy it across, instead of re-deriving the rule per surface.
*/

/**
 * Reserved Space id for the built-in Other view. User Space ids are minted as
 * `space-<position>-<base36 timestamp>` (see `createSidebarSpace`), so a real
 * Space can never claim this id.
 *
 * Other is never a membership target: it is not part of a Space state's `order`
 * or `spaces`, so the group / ungrouped-project "Spaces" submenus — which
 * enumerate that order — can never offer it as a toggle.

 * `collectionId` is the collection the project resolves to INCLUDING worktree
 * inheritance, exactly as the per-Space rule resolves it, and `spaces` is every
