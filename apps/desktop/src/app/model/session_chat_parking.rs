CDXC:SessionChat 2026-08-26:
Inactive project workspaces keep their live chat pages beside their parked shell
models, exactly like `ParkedAgentsTerminalRuntime` keeps their terminal owners.
Dropping the `Entity<CefSurface>` closes the Chromium browser, so a project
switch that destroyed them forced a visible kill + reload of every chat pane on
the way back.

Shell session ids are per-`WorkspaceModel` counters and therefore collide across
projects, so every companion map keyed by those ids travels in the same bundle:
leaving one behind would let the incoming project's ids read the outgoing
project's composer readiness, emptiness reports, or one-shot composer messages.
None of this is serialized; it returns only to the exact project that parked it.
